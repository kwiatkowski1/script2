What Are Codes?


Codes are, essentially, free gifts that developers and publishers provide to players. They usually arrive in the form of fun little phrases that you can redeem in-game. What you get for doing so can vary too. Typically it’s in-game currency, but you can occasionally get characters, item, boosts, and more.


If you play a game regularly, and prefer to avoid spending money, you should definitely keep an eye out for codes as often as possible.


Why is My Code Not Working?


If your code didn’t work when redeeming it, chances are that it’s expired. Most codes do have an expiration date, but we often don’t learn when this is at the point the codes are handed out. Instead, we test them regularly to see if they’re still working, but they’ll occasionally slip through the cracks.


Alternatively, it might be that you’ve redeemed that code already. You can typically only redeem a code a single time per account, so if you’ve redeemed one already it won’t work a second time. It’s worth making a note of which codes you’ve redeemed each time you do so.


Where Can I Get More Codes?


We update this article every single time a new code is released, so the best way to get more codes is to bookmark this page and check back regularly. That way, you’ll never miss out on a freebie.


You can also follow the official Facebook and Twitter accounts, or join the Discord. Developers usually hand out codes over social media, and even hand out different codes on each platform. So it’s worth following all of the above to ensure you never miss anything.
