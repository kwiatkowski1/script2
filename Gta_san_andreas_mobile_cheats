Full list of GTA San Andreas cheats for Android


Cheats are widely regarded as a vital feature of the 3D Universe GTA games by most fans. Out of all three 3D Universe titles, GTA San Andreas offers the maximum number of cheat codes. They're also the most diverse, with wide-ranging effects that can completely transform how the game plays out.


Cheat codes are supported on all available platforms, from the original PS2 console to the more recent Android release. However, some particular codes aren't accessible on all platforms. This article contains a list of all the supported cheats that have been found to work on this modern Android port of GTA San Andreas.


GTA San Andreas cheats for the Android version grouped according to their types


Unlike consoles where the controller buttons are used to input cheats, the PC version uses the keyboard instead. While Xbox cheats are also supported on PC and can be activated with a controller, this hasn't been confirmed to work on Android. Hence, Android users need to use their keyboards to type in cheats.


However, the usual keyboard apps won't work with the game. Players need a keyboard that can pop up while the game is running. An alternate method is to use the CLEO cheats mod, which negates the need to type in cheats manually. This article is for GTA San Andreas players who are using the former method.

These cheats primarily affect CJ and his stats. They can also be used to improve his skills, control his body features, and even to get superpowers.

Side effects of cheating


Cheating in GTA San Andreas has been shown to have a detrimental impact on missions and gameplay. Players are advised to use cheat codes only after the game has been finished or on an alternative save file to prevent any of these negative effects.


However, a save file containing cheats may, in rare cases, corrupt another clean save file because of how the game handles the cheat effects. Using any cheat code immediately locks up the ability to earn any achievements. They may also lead to game-breaking bugs on occasion.


Most importantly, players must apply common sense when applying cheats during missions. For example, players shouldn't use any wanted level cheat in a mission where the player is scripted to get a wanted level. If used carefully and only when necessary, cheats will not negatively affect the game.


List of all GTA San Andreas cheat codes for Android devices


GTA San Andreas is perhaps one of the most interesting games in the franchise. Even with its cartoonish vibe, the storyline, the characters, and the cartoonish vibe have helped the title cement itself as one of the finest titles out of Rockstar Games' repertoire.


The game is pretty lengthy compared to other PS2-era titles that came out around the same time.


GTA San Andreas also had a massive list of cheat codes, including the infamous cheat that spawned a jetpack. The list of cheats is so enormous that players still have to write them down, which makes the task pretty entertaining.


GTA San Andreas is also available on mobile devices. Unsurprisingly, the list of cheats has trickled down to the handheld devices as well.


GTA San Andreas cheats for Android users


Gamers will need to ensure they have an in-game keyboard available to insert cheats. Another method is to use the CLEO cheat mode, which negates the need to type in cheats manually.

GTA San Andreas' remastered version to come out later this year?


Rumors began perforating social media earlier this year, revealing that a remastered version of the PS2-era titles, including San Andreas and Vice City, was in the works.


A remastered version of GTA San Andreas is apparently in development (Image via INTER YouTube)


Rockstar seemingly sealed the deal by clamping down on popular GTA San Andreas and Vice City map mods.


Sadly, one of the most popular leakers, Tom Henderson, revealed that a remastered version of the titles above might get delayed. This is because the publisher has its hands full with the enhanced and expanded GTA 5 for new-gen console players.


The developer, on the flip side, has kept everything under wraps for now. However, it is possible that GTA players might hear more as the weeks go by.

Frequently Asked Questions


My iOS device isn’t recognizing my USB keyboard, what should I do?


This occurs when you are using an uncertified lightning to USB adapter. For Apple devices, it is highly recommended that you use original equipment, as most third-party equipment is unrecognized by Apple products. You can buy the official lightning to USB 3 camera adapter to connect your USB keyboard. It also comes with a charging port that can help power the keyboard (in case of lack of power).


Can I use a bluetooth keyboard with my iOS device?


Yes, you can. Many Bluetooth keyboards are supported by iOS. The most common and reliable one is the Logitech Bluetooth Keyboard.


How can I get Hacker’s Keyboard on my iOS device?


You cannot. Hacker's Keyboard is only available for Android. To get something remotely similar to Hacker's Keyboard, you would have to jailbreak your iOS device.
