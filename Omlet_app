Ratings and Reviews


Perfect but laggy


I found omlet when I wanted to play survival and stuff like that in minecraft but couldnt find anything. After a while of searching I finally found it, After I downloaded it I thought I created an account. So far this is a miracle to me.. so fun and EVERY details that i was looking for! I enjoy it so much it also has other games, and Chats too! Omlet doesnt have a thing I dont like EXCEPT That its laggy, like when i go into a minecraft world with someone its super laggy, if you could do anything to maybe boost it a bit it would be really good! I still have no complains about the app. I understand that it might be hard for people to play since theres alot of people joining one world and you have to put everyone on a VPN which makes minecraft think that we live in the same house and thats probably what makes it laggy! And I understand that it cant be done without changing your location (VPN) (Only if you dont sign in XBOX account) but if you could boost the lag by a bit this app would be my lifetime favorite app. It deserves a 5/5!
 


Could be better


While this is the “best” mobile streaming app for iOS it definitely has room for improvement. First off the kill cam has stopped working and still doesn’t work even though I switched from iPhone 8 to XR so the problem is in the app. It also has many times that it glitches with audio and even toggling the mic doesn’t seem to always fix it. It also glitches in PUBG a lot, one moment you are playing next you can’t hear anything in game until you turn your mic on in game. A nice feature I would like to see is the ability to choose what we stream, right now by default it stops and resumes your stream as you switch from app to app but I would love to have an option to keep streaming even as I switch so essentially screencast. It would also be cool to have a mic input selection maybe a viewer count overlay and please, please turn off the bloody auto play on the home screen. The final two things I can think of is maybe have an option to archives your streams such as twitch does, you have this with kill cam but not for entire stream and with kill cam broken this is pointless. Also should offer ads as a way to monetize the streams for both Omlet and its streamers. Omlet if you guys read this and decide to write back awesome I would love to hear back, but if you do and you like my ideas please do not ask me to email them to feedback, if you truly like them copy and paste into your own tracking cms as this is me leaving feedback.

Hi DarkRain1190,
1. We're sorry, due to iOS's system limitations, audio cannot be simultaneously captured for in-game voice chats and live streaming sometimes. 
To capture your in-game voice chat on stream,please make sure both your microphone audio and in-game voice chat are on before you start streaming.
You can use a headset for the best quality streaming experience.
2. About killcam: 
We are really sorry for the issues regarding kill cam. We will be working to improve this issue and hope for a fix soon! Sorry for any inconvenience. 
If you encounter any additional issues, please feel free to contact us at https://omlet.zendesk.com/hc/requests/new

Really upset !


I’ve known of omlet for quite sometime now. I never got the chance to use it because I didn’t stream much. I recently downloaded a game I enjoy very much and thought hey.. I should download a streaming app. “The gameplay is worth watching “ . but anyways I’ve been streaming now for about a week or two now . I downloaded omlet because it showed promise and had a lot of traffic . From day one I had a couple of issues due to the fact I’m new to iPhone and new to omlet. But within a couple of days I had it going. Viewers watched and grew faster than I thought . I hit 3k views within a 2 weeks. I know it isn’t much but I was sure dam proud of it. So let’s fast forward. I recently updated omlet . Now omlet can’t stay open . When ever I open my omlet account it’ll load then exit out. When I look at my apps in the background it’s there but it won’t stay on my screen . It always exits out when I press on it . Overall I can’t use my omlet anymore and I love the app but now I feel like I wasted so many hours streaming and building a fan base just for it not to work . And it’s just added irritation that I’m getting such difficulties within app while using the newest phones out. ”iPhone X” yes I have an iPhone X . I shouldn’t be having this problem . So many streamers on omlet that use phones that are years old. Please fix this issue. It’s my day off and there’s nothing else I would rather do than to stream on omlet. please!!
