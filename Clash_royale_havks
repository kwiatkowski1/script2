Clash Royale hacks and cheats: Why you should never use them


Clash Royale is one of the most popular games we have on the mobile platform. Supercell’s strategy game is known for its fast-paced gameplay and challenging levels. This occasionally tempts a few players to go the “illegal” route, indulging in hacks and cheats. Players will try to exploit and take advantage of the system. So, in this article, we will explain why players should never use or support players who use Clash Royale hacks and cheats.


Hackers and Cheaters in Clash Royale


There are a few yet disgusting number of hackers that are still on the platform. In Clash Royale, the first form of hacking is lag switching. Most in the Reddit community have also reportedly played against players who unethically lag switch their opponent. By the time they log back in, the player has already crowned them three times. These types prefer to climb the ladder in this manner to stay on top.


We realise it’s not fun, but that’s not how these things work for them. Other methods include using bots to manage matches and obtaining unlimited supplies such as Gems and Coins. This is mostly tried by many players so that they can get the easier route to claim their rewards and progress.


Reasons why hacks and cheats should be avoided in Clash Royale


The main reason why you should avoid using hacks and cheats is that it violates the game’s terms of service and may result in your account being suspended or permanently banned. This means you risk losing all of your game progress as well as any money spent on in-game purchases, which is something no player wants to happen.


The risk of privacy is another huge reason why players should refrain from such activities. We already know players log in using their Supercell ID or Google Play Sign-in, which stores the data of your personal information. If you hack using illegal methods, the ones who ready hacks can gain access to your user account. It also poses a significant risk to the security of your personal information and has the potential to leak yours online.


You could download malicious software that could damage your device as well. Players will not be able to update their game because cheats do not support the most recent configuration, resulting in a loss of gaming experience. Finally, it is disrespectful to other players who are playing fairly, which eliminates the thought of the game.


Supercell strictly enforces the fair play policy which prohibits any suspicious activity deemed detrimental to the community or the player base. As a result, avoid these things and concentrate on having fun while putting in a good effort.
