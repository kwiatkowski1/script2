As you type, Dictionary homes in on the word you are looking for. Then you can follow the links in the definition page to get more word definitions.


Wildcard characters can be used to help with word games like crosswords and scrabble where only some of the letters are known, or you have to find an anagram, or with spelling.

You can see your word history and revisit definitions, or make your own list of favourite words to help build up your vocabulary.

Alchemic Phone 7


*** 3rd best reviewed game on WP7 ! Thanks . 
*** Listed among Gizmodo Essentials *** 
Are you a good Alchemist ? 
You are tasked with rebuilding the universe, bit by bit, or rather Element by Element. Starting with just 6 Elements (no, not just 4) and combining them using your skills, wits and knowledge, you will unlock 1700 more and 26 Realms. 
Do you think you can you discover: Atomic Energy, Zeppelin, Chuck Norris, Atlantis or even ‘Angry Birds’ ? 
Similar games include Doodle God, but please note that this is brand new, built from scratch, taking the concept directly from the old 80s ‘Alchemy’ and reinventing it in the process.


IT’S HUGE ! 
The game includes 1600 discoverable Elements, but grows with updates and your suggestions. In fact if you have an idea for a combination or feel that two elements should react, the game provides a direct link for the suggestion. 
UNLOCK REALMS: 
As you progress, you will find new Elements which will unlock more Realms 
SCORING AND TARGETS: 
A scoring system is included (but you can also have fun without it) that gives big rewards for target key Elements or unlocking new Realms. You also get a Target Element of the Day ! 
ONLINE SCORES: 
Once you feel like bragging, you can post your World Discovery % and score on the Leaderboard. Leave a comment and tease your friends ! 
FRIEND MODE: 
Have a friend who wants to play ? Check “Friend Mode” in settings. 
HINTS: 
Finding some key elements can be a (reasonable) challenge but it wouldn’t be fun otherwise. A multiple hint functionality that doesn’t spoil too much of the research process is available. If you are really stuck please check the companion app ! 
WORLD STATUS: 
Shows Realms. By tapping on an element tile you can see the reactions where it took part. 
WIKIPEDIA: 
Helpful and interesting, you can access an Element page by tapping on its name. 
ENHANCE THE GAME: 
Get the companion “Alchemic Extras 7” .
