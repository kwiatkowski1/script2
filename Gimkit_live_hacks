AhaSlides is an all-in-one presentation, education and training tool. It’s a simple, easy-to-use and free alternative to Kahoot, with a no-pay plan that gives you all the freedom you need to host incredible interactive presentations.


It’s all slide-based and is super easy to get to grips with. Simply build a presentation from the 17 available slide types, send the unique room code to your audience, and then proceed through your slides as your participants interact live with each one.


More than a gaming tool, AhaSlides lets you gather opinions through polls, share ideas through brainstorms, make word cloud, hold Q&As, run live quizzes, and yes, play games (like the spinner wheel) as well. Therefore, AhaSlides offer the best alternatives to Kahoot Games for Adults


All of this sits at a very reasonable price and a planning system that won’t make your head spin!


Key Pros of AhaSlides ✅



  
The free plan is actually usable – While Kahoot’s free plan gives you very little to work with, AhaSlides lets you use pretty much all of its features straight off the bat. The main limitation of its free plan relates to the size of your audience, so if you have more than 7 participants, you’ll have to upgrade. Still, that’s not much of a problem because…

  
It was cheap! – AhaSlides’s Pricing is starting from $7.95 monthly (annual plan), as well as its plans for teachers, start at $2.95 a month (annual plan) for a standard-sized class.

  
Flexibility is king – AhaSlides never locks you into an annual subscription. Monthly plans reign supreme and can be cancelled at any time. Though of course, annual plans are available for long-termers looking to save.

  
Multi-channel customer support – Support is available through documentation, live chat, email and via messaging on social media channels. You always speak to a real human, no matter the query.

  
Layout options – Variety to change the background, font and text colour

  
Reports available – Both in excel and PDF!




Key Cons of AhaSlides ❌



  
There’s no mode to test a presentation – Before running a presentation, you’ll want to test it. While Kahoot has a specific test mode for this, on AhaSlides you’ll just have to join your own presentation on multiple other devices.

2. GimKit Live


For gamification of teaching.


Compared to the goliath that is Kahoot, GimKit’s 4-person team very much takes on the role of David. Despite the fact that GimKit has clearly borrowed from the Kahoot model, or maybe because of it, it sits very high on our list of alternatives to Kahoot.


The bones of it are that GimKit is a very charming and fun way to get students engaged in lessons. The question offerings it provides are simple (just multiple choice and type answers), but it offers many inventive game modes and a virtual money-based scoring system to keep students coming back time and again.


Quite crucially for ex-Kahoot users, it’s an absolute breeze to use. The navigation is simple and you can go from creation to presentation without needing a single onboarding message.


If GimKit Live wasn’t enough, your $4.99 a month will also get you access to GimKit Ink, a tool to help your students share and discuss their work.


Key Pros of GimKit Live



  
Great pricing and plan – Not many teachers could sniff at a maximum of $4.99 per month. Considering Kahoot’s labyrinthine pricing structure; GimKit Live is a breath of fresh air with its one all-encompassing plan.

  
It’s super varied – The premise of GimKit Live is very simple, but the amount of game mode variations make it difficult for students to get bored. It also lets students create their own questions for a ‘kit’ and it keeps competition levels high over long periods of time with its awesome ‘seasons’ mode.

  
The power of money – In-game money is super fun to acquire and can be spent at the shop on personal power-ups. This is great for student motivation.




Key Cons of GimKit Live



  
Fairly one-dimensional – GimKit Live’s got great motivating power, but usually in short bursts. At the heart of it, there’s not much more to it than asking students questions and dishing out money for answers. It’s best used sparingly in the classroom.

  
Question types are limited – If you just want a simple quiz with multiple-choice and open-ended questions, then GimKit Live will do. However, if you’re after ordering questions, ‘closest answer wins’ questions or mix-and-match questions, you’re best looking for another Kahoot alternative.




3. Quizizz


If you’re thinking of leaving Kahoot, but are worried about leaving that enormous library of amazing user-created quizzes behind, then you better check out Quizizz.


Quizizz boasts over 1 million pre-made quizzes in every field you can imagine. Within a few clicks you can download one, edit it, host it live for friends or assign it asynchronously for a class at school. It’s very easy to use and the friction is minimal.


For teachers without a lot of time on their hands, or really anyone wanting accessibility to monthly plans, Quizizz can be a top Kahoot alternative.


Key Pros of Quizizz



  
Fantastic shortcuts – You can use another user’s quiz as your own, and can even ‘teleport’ specific questions from others’ quizzes into yours. These shortcuts can help you create a quiz in a matter of minutes.

  
Great reports – The reports system is detailed and allows you to create flashcards out of questions on which participants didn’t answer so well.

  
Lovely design – Navigation is slick and the illustrations and colour of the whole dashboard are very professional.




Key Cons of Quizizz



  
Fewer question types than expected – For a piece of kit devoted almost entirely to quizzing, you might expect a few more question types beyond the multiple choice, multiple answer and type answer questions available.

  
No live support – Unfortunately, those fed up with Kahoot’s lack of live chat might feel likewise with Quizizz. Support is limited to email, Twitter and support tickets.




4. Canvas


For designing full courses and monitoring individual students.


The only Learning Management System (LMS) on the list of Kahoot alternatives is Canvas. Canvas is one of the best all-in-one education systems out there, and is trusted by millions of teachers to plan and deliver interactive lessons, and then measure the impact of that delivery.


Canvas helps teachers to structure entire modules by breaking them down into units, and then into individual lessons. Between the structuring and analysing phases, a pretty staggering amount of tools including scheduling, quizzing, speed grading and live chat give teachers what they need. There’s even an in-built studio for creating videos!


If there’s any tool that seems to be lacking, users can usually find it in one of the app integrations.


Being an LMS of this stature naturally comes with a pretty hefty price tag, though there is a free plan available with limited features.


Key Pros of Canvas



  
Reliability – For those with trust issues, you need not worry. Canvas is very vocal about its 99.99% uptime and prides itself on the fact that only the slightest of ultra-slight changes will cause the software to fail on you.

  
Packed full of features – It’s truly hard to keep tabs on the number of features that Canvas offers its users. Even the free plan lets you create entire courses, though options for in-class teaching are limited.

  
Community communication – Canvas have built a strong and active community of teachers, administrators and students. Many members are brand evangelists and will post religiously on the forum to help out fellow teachers.




Key Cons of Canvas



  
Feeling overwhelmed? – It’s easy to buckle under the weight of everything Canvas has to offer. Tech-savvy educators may love it, but teachers looking for something simple to incorporate into their classes should look at one of the other alternatives to Kahoot on this list.

  
Hidden pricing – There’s no way to know for sure how much Canvas is going to cost you. You have to contact them for a quote, which soon leads to you being at the mercy of the sales department.

  
Design – From a look at the Canvas dashboard, you wouldn’t guess that Canvas is one of the biggest LMS in the world. Navigation is okay, but the design is rather simplistic.

5. Slido


For text-based presentations.


Like AhaSlides, Slido is an audience-interaction tool, meaning that it has a place both inside and outside of a classroom. It also works pretty much the same way – you create a presentation, your audience joins it and you proceed through live polls, Q&As and quizzes together.


The difference is that Slido focuses more on team meetings and training than education, games or quizzes. The love of images and colour that a lot of alternatives to Kahoot (including Kahoot) has is replaced in Slido by ergonomic functionality.


The editor reflects on this. You’ll not see a single image while creating on the Slido editor, but you’ll see a good selection of slide types and some neat analytics for after-event summarising.


Key Pros of Slido



  
Integrates directly with Google Slides and PowerPoint – This means you can embed a bit of Slido-brand audience participation directly into your presentation.

  
Simple plan system – Slido’s 8 plans is a refreshingly simple alternative to Kahoot’s 22. You can figure out your ideal plan fairly quickly and all on one page.




Key Cons of Slido



  
Uniform greyness – By far the biggest con of Slido is that there’s very little room for creativity or vibrancy. Kahoot certainly doesn’t do much in terms of personalising colour or text, but it at least has more options than Slido.

  
Annual plans only – Like with Kahoot, Slido doesn’t really offer monthly plans; it’s yearly or nothing!

  
Expensive one-timers – Also like Kahoot, one-time plans may just break the bank. $69 is the cheapest, while $649 is the most expensive.




6. ClassMarker


For no-frills, personalised quizzes.


When you boil Kahoot down to the bones, it’s mainly used as a way to test students rather than impart new knowledge on them. If that’s the way you use it, and you aren’t too concerned with the extra frills, then ClassMarker might be your perfect, free alternative to Kahoot!


ClassMarker isn’t concerned with flashy colours or popping animation; it knows its purpose is to help teachers test students and analyse their performance. Its more streamlined focus means that it actually has more question types than Kahoot and provides a lot more opportunities for personalising those questions.


While the basics are all available for free, there’s still a lot hiding behind the paywall. Analytics, certificates, the ability to upload images… it’s all stuff the modern educator might want, but it’s only available for a minimum of $19.95 a month.


Key Pros of ClassMarker



  
Simple and focused – ClassMarker is perfect for those overwhelmed by the noise of Kahoot. It’s easy to use, easy to navigate and easy to test.

  
Incredible variety – There are the standard multiple choice, true or false and open-ended questions, but also matching pairs, grammar spotting and essay questions. There are even different types within those question types, as well as the chance to change the scoring system, add fake answers to throw students off the scent, and more.

  
More ways to personalise – Break the uniformity with different formatting. You can ask questions with tables and mathematical equations, and also link in images, video, audio and other documents, though these require the paid version.




Key Cons of ClassMarker



  
Younger students might find it less ‘woke’ – ClassMarker is essentially Kahoot on valium, but that might not sit well with students who prefer the glitz of the latter compared to the pragmatism of the former.

  
Students need accounts – On the ClassMarker free version, you need to assign quizzes to ‘groups’, and the only way to make a group is to have all students within that group sign up to ClassMarker.

  
Limited assistance – Though there are some videos and documentation, and the chance to email someone, you’re pretty much on your own when using the software.




7. Poll Everywhere


For live polls and Q&A sessions.


Again, if it’s simplicity and student opinions you’re after, then Poll Everywhere might just be your best alternative to Kahoot.


This software gives you decent variety when it comes to asking questions. Opinion polls, surveys, clickable images and even some (very) basic quiz facilities mean you can have lessons with the student at the centre, though it’s clear from the setup that Poll Everywhere is far more suited to the work environment than to schools.


Unlike Kahoot, Poll Everywhere isn’t about games. There are no flashy visuals and a limited colour palette to say the least, with virtually zero in the way of personalisation options.


Key Pros of Poll Everywhere



  
Lenient free plan – As a free software like Kahoot, Poll Everywhere is rather generous with the freebies. Unlimited questions of all types and a maximum audience number of 25.

  
Good variety – Multiple choice, word cloud, Q&A, clickable image, open-ended, survey and ‘competition’ are the 7 question types you have, though many of these are quite basic.




Key Cons of Poll Everywhere



  
Still quite limited – Despite the leniency and the variety, there’s a lot that you can’t do on Poll Everywhere without splashing the cash. Customisation, reports and the ability to create teams are all hidden behind a paywall, though these are basic offerings on other Kahoot alternatives.

  
No new updates – It seems like the developers of Poll Everywhere have more-or-less given up on updating the service. Don’t expect any new developments if you sign up.

  
All alone – Don’t expect much of a conversation with support staff either. There are a few guides to help you on your way, but communication is exclusively through email only.

  
One access code – With Poll Everywhere, you don’t create a separate presentation with a separate join code for each lesson. You only get one join code (your username), so you have to constantly ‘active’ and ‘deactivate’ questions that you do or don’t want to appear.




Takeaways: The Problems with Kahoot!


As one of the top alternatives to Kahoot, we at AhaSlides have been helping ex-Kahoot users move over to the simpler, cheaper and safer side. Here’s some of what we hear those users complaining about the most….

  Problem Description Is best Kahoot Alternative for this?    Limited free plan Kahoot’s free plan allows for 2 question types – multiple choice and true or false. No flexibility in stuff like number of answers, multiple answer select, typed answers, etc. AhaSlides  The plan system A staggering 22 plans to choose from, not including tailored enterprise. Never easy to find which suits you best; each plan has subtle differences and requires navigation through an instruction manual’s worth of pages to figure out. GimKit Live  Expensive The number 1 reason that people are moving from Kahoot. Kahoot Pricing is not just confusing, but for many plans, it’s also really high. A one-off event will cost a minimum of $250 – that’s 85x more expensive than its competitors! Poll Everywhere  Inflexible plans For most Kahoot plans, you’ll be locked into an entire year’s subscription, as monthly plans are mostly not available. AhaSlides  Limited audience numbers Kahoot it live is quite expensive, but only up to 2,000 participants. Enough for many, sure, but organisers of big events have to look towards Kahoot alternatives. AhaSlides  Limited personalisation No way to make a Kahoot yours. No options to change the layout, background, colour or text on any slide.
Also, Kahoot has a very limited function. As a group member, you can view and host Kahoot! that is shared within the group, but can multiple people edit a Kahoot? NO. AhaSlides  Stability No software can claim to have an uptime of 100%, but we’ve heard from many teachers who say that Kahoot has failed them at a vital moment. Canvas  Easy to hack Not really Kahoot’s fault, this one, but the worldwide use of the software leaves it open to sabotage. There are even full communities and websites set up to ruin live Kahoot games! ClassMarker  Limited customer support Email is the only channel with which to contact a human at Kahoot. The live chat is a rather apathetic robot. Therefore, it’s quite difficult to contact for more support for Kahoot Monthly Subscription, or simply cancel the Kahoot subscription. AhaSlides
