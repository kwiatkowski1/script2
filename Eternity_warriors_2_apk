Eternity Warriors 2


Eternity Warrriors 2 is a role and action game in which we play the role of the warrior chosen by destiny to face an army from hell which is leaded by some of the most dreaded demons known by human kind.


Throughout our adventure we will bump into dozens of different demons that will try to stand in the way of our victory. To overcome them we will only be able to do one thing: fight them using all our skills and weapons that we will find and acquire along the way thanks to experience.


The way in which the battle develops is very similar to any RPG such as Diablo. We will have to click on the enemy that we want to hit and that´s it; our character will start launching attacks at him. Of course, we will also have to use the special abilities on an ongoing basis, which is essential if we want to survive.


Eternity Warriors 2 is a remarkable RPG that on top of a long and entertaining campaign, offers great graphics and the possibility to enjoy it in a cooperative way through the internet with a friend, or alone: two different experiences but likewise entertaining.

Eternity Warriors 2 APK for Android


Eternity Warriors 2 is everything you'd expect from a mobile game about gods and goddesses-a challenging, action-packed role-playing game with lots of levels and item collecting, and lots of great items and powers to use in battle. I can't say much for the story, other than it's pretty good. I'm not going to spoil it for you, but I'll just give a quick synopsis. Eternity Warriors 2 is now out on the Android Market and should be available on iPhone and iPad soon too.


Eternity Warriors 2 is your classic tower defense game where you have to defend the world from an endless horde of demonic creatures trying to destroy your cave base. The first thing you'll notice is that the in-game interface and menus are much smaller and cleaner looking on the Android screen vs. the iPhone and iPad. You move around the map and fight off waves of enemies by tapping the screen to attack and defending yourself.


You'll also notice that Eternity Warriors 2 has a great deal more to offer compared to its precursor. You now battle against demons instead of dragons, as well as gruff beings known as the undead. These creatures are tougher and require more tactics to defeat. Plus, you can now recruit fellow fighters into your army, who can be sent into battle as a support if you get surrounded or are taking heavy damage. The online community for Eternity Warriors 2 is large and is a fun place to hang out and discuss the game with fellow players. The Android version does not have these features, but considering the fact that it's free on the Android Market, I doubt that they would have many complaints.

Battle Demons on your Mobile Device with Eternity Warriors 2


Eternity Warriors 2 is a free-to-play RPG with multiplayer features. Build up your hero and join a battle against evil forces.


Create a Hero and Join the Quest


Eternity Warriors 2 continues the storyline of the original Eternity Warriors by depicting a new stage in the war between men and demons. As a demon-fighting hero, your job is to explore dungeons, collect objects and fight off deadly monsters. The further you progress, the stronger your hero will become; but at the same time, your enemies will also grow more formidable.


Multiplayer Adventures


While the storyline of heroes fighting demons is hardly original, Eternity Warriors 2 does a solid job of recreating the feel of classic dungeon-crawling RPGs such as Gauntlet. The presence of multiplayer modes mean that you can increase the fun by pulling some friends together to join in on your quests. Although the game is free to download and play, it does offer in-app purchases to help enhance your hero; you can get by without these, but your progress will be slower.
