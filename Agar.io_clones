any good agar.io clones with active developers?


I enjoyed playing the game until Miniclip molded it into it's image and all development ceased. Also, No Mitos.is.


Cell.sh! Is a brand new Agar.io clone!


Oh wow. The closest to original clone I've seen. I played it for the past hour, and indeed it remainded me the good old Agario without teams. On the other hand, I made it easily to 28k+ and dominated the room for almost an hour. I've never been this big in regular Agario FFA. So it must have been lag for others (I am almost sure it was the issue for some players), a lot of new players or something significally different in game's mechanics.


Interesting game, it would be cool if there were an option to play offline since it's so heavily and obviously bot-supported. Also a great training ground for drag shots, popsplits, etc.


Currently working with someone to create a new home base for teamers and solo players.


No malicious advertising, (We use Google Adsense now.)


Already working on our own anti teaming solutions And custom upgrades (No pay to win bullshit)


IMO - anti-teaming via program is not necessary. I believe naming a mode as 'Only Solo' would sufficiently stop teaming behavior, while keeping Free For All as it is (free style).


Good! Best one I've seen so far. Also, I like the fact that Big Food mode exists, not entirely that the game mode exists but more that it's new and not copy pasted agar.io


Played 2 minutes at cell.sh - teamers are already taking over FFA and it is lagging. //Shrug.
