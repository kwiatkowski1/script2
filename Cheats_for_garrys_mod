Cheats for garrys mod


First, start by opening console with the tilde (~) key and typing in this command:


Not everything you learn here will need cheats, remember that!


Now here are some commands you can try:


BUDDHA: Take damage but never die (only have 1 health left)


givecurrentammo: Easiest to use when you have a key bound, gives you max ammo for any weapon


Give is a simple and awesome command, and is effective when you bind a key to it.


You can give yourself any kind of weapon, but i will use HL2 as an example


It goes on and on, but here are some useful items:


You should bind a key for those 2.


You can look up all of the item names on the internet if you want.


Remember that weapon sway in HL2? Made the game feel smooth right?


You need to use these 2 commands: (sv_cheats not needed)


interp = the amount of time before the weapon goes back


scale = intesity of the sway


my preferences are - interp = 0.2 | scale = 2


This command can be used in other source games outside of this, remember that!


You can change your on screen HUD view with this command:


You will then need to find a certain screen overlay, my personal favorite:


There are other overlays in the Q menu too


To go into thirdperson (cheats required)


go into console and simply type "thirdperson"


To go back type "firstperson"
