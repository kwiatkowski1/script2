All Dead by Daylight codes list April 2023


New DBD codes are released regularly, and here are all the currently active ones, and those that have expired, for in-game freebies like charms and Bloodpoints.


DBD codes can actually be quite hard to keep up with, since they are given out pretty regularly – but of course that’s no bad thing. We’re never going to complain about in-game giveaways, and Dead By Daylight codes can give you anything from outfits to charms, and even Bloodpoints and Iridescent Shards.


Whether you want your favourite DBD killers to get a stylish new look, or you want to add to your survivors’ wardrobes, be sure to redeem the codes below before it’s too late, which are accompanied by some other ongoing codes to snap up if you haven’t already.

How to redeem Dead by Daylight codes


Redeeming DBD codes is pretty simple – you’ve just got to know where to look.



  
Once you’re logged into the game, head to the store.

  
In the store, click the “Redeem Code” button in the top right hand

  
corner.

  
Enter the code as it appears above.

  
Click “Redeem”.




My DBD code isn’t working


If your code isn’t working, you should be able to see an error message below the redemption box that will tell you the problem. If you don’t see anything, check that you have entered the code accurately, bearing in mind that is it case-sensitive.


Dead by Daylight redemption error codes: 



  
“This code could not be redeemed because you already own the associated item.”

  
“This code has already been claimed.”

  
“This code is not valid. Please double check you have entered it correctly and try again.”

  
“This code has expired.”




How to spend Bloodpoints


While some of the active DBD codes above earn you cosmetics like outfit items or charms, most reward you with Bloodpoints. Bloodpoints are an in-game currency used to level up your characters, but they cannot be redeemed for cosmetics or other shop items, nor can they be exchanged into Auric Cells, Iridescent Shards, or Rift Fragments.


The only use for Bloodpoints, therefore, is levelling up DBD killers and survivors by spending them in the Bloodweb. Thanks to a recent update, you can level up automatically, or you can choose each individual item to ‘purchase’ with Bloodpoints, from your random selection of offerings, perks, and add-ons. Each level of the Bloodweb adds these items to your collection, and levels your character up. Get through 50 levels of the Bloodweb to prestige your character.


With that, you can redeem all the latest DBD codes, kit your main out with some new styles, and level up with all those Bloodpoints. There might not be any new gear for The Cannibal this time around, but we do at least know that Leatherface is sticking around in DBD, following rumours that the licence would be revoked ahead of the new Texas Chainsaw Massacre game. If horror games are your thing, then perhaps that will be a new one to try out, or you can check our list of the best PC games for an idea of something else to play.


 Danielle Rose Please don't ask Danielle what her favourite PC games or genres are, she'll never give the same answer. Currently, you'll find her playing Minecraft, Disney Dreamlight Valley, and Dead by Daylight - not necessarily all at the same time.
