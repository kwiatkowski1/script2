README.md 


FlyGuys is simple cheat for FallGuys written in c++. It's internal but can be easily ported to external (that was my goal). It's my first cheat for unity and i know some things can be done better or just use mono injector but it was not my goal like i said. Offsets are updated, but some features may not work because i coded it at closed beta and some things could have changed.



  
Fly mode

  
No collisions (you will still get pushed by external forces)

  
No stun

  
Speed boost

  
ESP for real doors (Door rush)

  
ESP for real tiles (TipToe)

  
ESP for not "jinxed" players

  
Unlimited money (probably patched)

  
Support for controllers




You can just update it easily with https://github.com/Perfare/Il2CppDumper just put new il2cpp.h and new offsets which you will find in script.json


You can do a lot of things myself just look into character->fields._data and have fun.
