Reviews:


Malan: It's awesome when you open it and all the applications are already there, which saves a lot of time and is just cool. But it doesn't always install everything; it was only one of eleven items that weren't in the play store, to begin with, but it did install the other two from the same pc.


Foxworth Barly: It's a good app, but it offers me much more than I want. I'm just interested in local data, but this software offers you a number of choices for installing applications you don't need. To make it a 5-star app, they should remove the extra nonsense.


Alshiti roan: Excellent application. It's what I need to mount anything. I still request that the app's developers make the app installable because it claims it's corrupt but other than that, it's awesome.


Chrisman con: If the notification "Nice application available" occurs while attempting to install applications, simply open "APK Installer."
