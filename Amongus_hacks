A game that becomes hot in 2020 with attractive and sensitive gameplay is Among Us. Players will be randomly assigned to the Crewmate and Impostor side and complete their goals with absolute precision. At the same time, all factors can enhance your true identity, so be careful in your actions and do not get kicked off the ship.


A NEW TASK HAS JUST BEEN ADDED


The environments are pretty varied, and there are also exciting quests specific to that environment that you will spend time experiencing. At the same time, a new mission has just been added that is Vent Clean, and the name says it all when you will need to find a way to clean this place. This location is often associated with the Impostors in the game, so there are a few factors that you will need to be careful about and can confirm that this mission will impact gameplay.


When you go to an area to clean the vent, an unexpected thing will happen: the Impostorâ€™s desire to run down the vent will not be possible. In other words, the button will not appear when the Impostor goes to the cleaned place. An Impostor is in the vent but hasnâ€™t left yet, and a Crewmate comes to clean it; indeed, the person in it will be revealed, and you will know how to report the enemy. So when you go clear vent, go with a lot of people you trust.


PARTICIPATE IN EXCITING LEVELS


When you want to create a game screen, you will be interested in many factors. Some factors that you will need to consider are the playersâ€™ number, the Impostors number, whether the enemyâ€™s identity is revealed when they are thrown into space, and the duration of the skill. Precisely, these factors will often determine the challenge of the gameplay of this game that you will need to go through. From there, before starting the game, you will need to consult with the host to adjust them properly.


The gameplay of Among Us is straightforward, and it is inspired by the werewolf game when each player knows their function and tries to do their part well to win the level. Crewmates will need to eliminate all the Impostors on the ship with the clues they collect in the game. At the same time, if Crewmate is brought down to the same number as Impostor, then the victory will undoubtedly favor the killers in this game. So this is enjoyable gameplay.


Sometimes, implementing the above goal will take a long time for both sides, so the game also has another requirement. That is to complete the number of quests for Crewmate and the Impostor will perform his acts of sabotage and wait until the emergency is up. Therefore, any player needs to be alert to the elements he is performing and pay careful attention to his surroundings.


MAKE REASONABLE CONCLUSIONS


Once you know the goals of these two sides, you will surely realize that the characteristics of these two types of characters will be completely different except for the one point that they can detect corpses and call meetings. As for Impostors will have better night vision, and they are often unable to perform tasks â€“ typical of Crewmate. So at the start of the game, the hunter will usually get a list of fake tasks, and their job is to go there and stand so other players donâ€™t get suspicious.


Crewmates will flawlessly execute the tasks they receive and try to get the taskbar to 100%. While performing tasks can be faked, some tasks have signaling effects that the active character will report as Crewmates. So thatâ€™s why players will need to be careful with whatâ€™s around them, and the game also integrates a camera room so you can make observations of other playersâ€™ actions.


Once you have reached your conclusions regarding the Impostor, you can then hold a meeting or stand near a dead body to make the announcement. The players here will give their arguments inside a chatbox, and after the discussion time is up, they will vote for the person they find suspicious or skip the vote. So whoever gets more votes will be eliminated and turned into a ghost. It can move freely and continue to do what it left unfinished except for killing other players.


JOIN MANY OTHER PLAYERS


It is an online game; indeed, you will not be able to skip the matches with your friends or other players. You can join or create a match with the number of players from 4 -15 people depending on your preference. As mentioned above, creating room also needs to be carefully considered to avoid a conflict in the number and strength of one side. At the same time, the number of colors and accessories that you find in the game is also fascinating and helps you personalize your character.
