Cons:


Clean Master for Windows


Clean Master is a free cleaning application for your computer that offers a limited number of free features. While it's debated whether or not PC cleaner applications work, they’re an easy way to remove junk files. This function makes Clean Master a useful application as you only need one click to delete the cache.


Clean your PC


Clean Master is a useful application that helps clean your computer by removing various junk files and cache. Clearing your unwanted folders and items will increase space on your hard drive, often by 100Mb each week. From Google Chrome to games and other software, every program you use creates cached files every time it is launched.


Deleting cache is not harmful and won’t remove any essential information.


Speed up your system


Clean Master optimizes your system and network settings to prevent lag and speed up your computer's performance. One useful way your system's speed increases involves clearing tracers and other items that interferes with your online privacy.


Additionally, the drive booster option can scan, update, and fix your hard drive. The mode supports over five million devices and drivers.


Premium locked


Once you download Clean Master, you'll only have access to a few limited features without purchasing premium. These limitations only allow you to use junk cleaning and PC boost features. However, by buying a license, you'll unlock all the extra features, such as file shredder and file recovery.


Intelligent design


Clean Master for PC uses a well-designed interface to provide its many utilities for your device. With a single click, you can scan and clear almost all of your cached junk files. You can quickly locate the app's main features on the sidebar and activate them immediately.


Many side features


Clean Master includes many additional features such as file shredder, file recovery, browser auto-recovery, and an auto-update mode.


Our take


Overall, Clean Master is a decent application worth installing for the free version, especially if you’ve got many cached files. Alternatively, you can use the tools from popular antiviruses such as AVG PC Tuneup and Avast Cleanup. This app works well, though, and has many additional features aside from clearing your cache.


Should you download it?


Yes. If your computer feels sluggish, installing Clean Master will be beneficial.

Clean Master for Android


Clean Master provides six functions for cleaning and protecting Android devices. It scans for viruses, frees up storage space, speeds up your phone, saves battery, test for secure WiFi connections, and manage games. Is it worth the download, then?


Bold claims


The idea of optimizing your phone sounds great. What sounds even better is an easy-to-use app to help you do several tasks at once. After downloading Clean Master, you’ll be able to understand its many functions straight away. The clean interface and detailed dashboard provide everything you need to know about what the app can do for your phone.


Clean Master does a good job of demonstrating what it is doing, but its effectiveness ends there. When using the junk file removal service, the actual storage on the phone doesn’t change, even though the app dashboard says otherwise. Android has developed its tool for clearing a cache, to free up space on your phone. When testing phone speeds, the optimization tools made little to no difference. This makes downloading an app for these functions unnecessary.


When it comes to the other features of the app, the virus protection would have the most use; however, in comparison to software programs like AVG for Android, it isn’t as comprehensive regarding malware. The biggest downside of the app is the full-screen advertisements that play with every use of a feature. The advertisements are frustrating, and make the app counterintuitive, slowing down phone processes and draining the battery.


Where can you run this program?


Clean Master requires Android devices with version 9.0 installed.


Is there a better alternative?


Yes. If you want to free up space, use your Android settings. If you want protection, use a dedicated security app such as AVG.


Our take


You might feel good when you see the dials and stats on the dashboard, but the repetitive advertisements and lack of results will soon change that.


Should you download it?


No. If you are looking for something that delivers any one of the features of this app, you’ll find dedicated alternatives that do it better.
