Very based cheat for the game Devour.


Well at this point i don't really know, i think there is some sort of native Unity anti cheat template but it doesn't seem active. You're fine, no anti cheat !


Everything about spoofing ehre (steam name, server name, level. ) will persist if you don't uncheck it (it will be reseted when you'll restart the game obv).



  
An IMGUI menu thanks to UnityEngine

  
Fully compatible with the new IL2CPP version of the game

  
Detects if you're in game (with bad code lol), so no chances of crashing on main menu by activating features

  
Detects the map you are playing on (useful for the instant win)

  
Big Flashlight (allows your flashlight to light a lot more)

  
Flashlight color customization (with a home made color picker)

  
Unlimited UV light (thanks to @jadis0x)

  
A chat spammer for Lobby and InGame chat (i couldn't do a text entry because of the limitations of Il2CppAssemblyUnhollower)

  
Achievements unlocker (couldn't do all of them, my code is crashing for some reasons at some point, i may fix it, for now it's commented out)

  
Doors unlocker (should work fine, though it doesn't seem to work sometimes)

  
Keys teleporter

  
LV spoofer

  
Steam name spoofer (sets it to "patate", again no input text :/)

  
Server name spoofer (sets it to "patate on top !", again no input text :/)

  
Fly

  
Unlock all, including flashlights, perks, outfits. Active by default, can't be turned off, no persistance.

  
Instant Win (allows you to win instantaniously on any map, works in singleplayer, but not as a client. May be working as host)

  
Random Sound (make your character play a random acting sound)

  
Always carrying a medkit

  
Change your exp at the end of the game, changing it is permanant !

  
Player ESP (with a home made color picker)

  
Player skeleton ESP

  
Player snaplines (with a home made color picker)

  
Azazel ESP (with a home made color picker)

  
Azazel Skeleton ESP

  
Azazel snapline (with a home made color picker)

  
Item ESP

  
Demon ESP

  
Goat/Rat ESP

  
TP all the items to your position ! (thanks to @jadis0x)

  
Spawn any item/entity to your position

  
Walk in the lobby

  
Change the player's speed

  
Fullbright

  
Create a lobby with no player limit




For my French fellas out there, 1tap2times made a French video tutorial for the installation of the Mod : link 
For my German friends, KiwiJuice02 made a german video tutorial right here : link 
In order to get all of this working you need to generate the DevourClient.dll file by building the source code.



  
Install .NET 6 SDK and runtime.

  
Build the cheat from source.

  
Put the DevourClient.dll file located in DevourClient\bin\Release\net6.0 inside C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Devour\Mods folder.

  
Start the game, now you have successfully installed DevourClient. Use INSERT to open the menu





  
Delete the folders MelonLoader , Mods , Plugins , UserData , and the file version.dll from C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Devour





  
Clone the repository (or Code -> Download Zip)

  
Install MelonLoader V0.6.0 (go to Settings -> tick "Show ALPHA Pre-Releases") to Devour.

  
Start your game. A cmd should appear, don't close it, MelonLoader is installing and decompiling Devour's game assemblies.

  
Wait for the process to finish, once it's done close the game.

  
Open the solution file (DevourClient.sln) in Visual Studio

  
Go to : Project --> Add a reference --> Browse --> Click on the browse button in the down right corner of the window.

  
Add those files :
