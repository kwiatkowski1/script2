Criticism


This bundle is often used by Online Daters (OD'ers for short), because the "muscles" of it are considered attractive. People that use it are often singled out as Online Daters, even if the user doesn't online date.


Trivia



  
The description reads "faster than a plane, stronger than a cargo train," possibly referencing Superman.

  
It has visible muscles unlike its regular counterpart Robloxian 2.0 and its modern version ROBLOX Boy.

  
Out of all bundles based on the realistic style set by Robloxian 2.0 and Roblox 4.0 bodies, this is the only bundle to have more realistic legs due to its muscles.

Once you have them, you can start attacking other players.
