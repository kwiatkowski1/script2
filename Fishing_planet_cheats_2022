Fishing Planet Cheats for Playstation 4


Getting Started
Start out by following directions to complete the tutorial. After you finish, try pressing the F11 key to switch to overhead casting (I bound it to the "\" key to make it easier to find on a laptop keyboard). I suggest sticking with swing casting for now, however, because it gives long telescoping float poles the best leverage for strikes (when you raise the rod tip to set the hook) and avoids weeds.


I also like setting up keyboard keys as an alternative to mouse buttons/trackpad for "pulling" (reeling in) and striking. I use the "V" key as alt strike and space bar (default) for reeling in. You can press the shift key while reeling in for max retrieve speed. You should try adjusting the retrieve speed with the mouse wheel. Notice that you can reverse the retrieve direction and let some line out when the speed arrow points downward. This corresponds to disengaging the anti-reverse switch on real-life spinning reels.


Be sure to check out the in-game slideshow tutorials, accessible under the question mark icon on the inventory/map screen. They include information specific to different fish species in Lone Star Lake.


Home Ponds - Lesní Víla and Lone Star
All players start out on Lone Star Lake (Texas*) currently. There is plenty of experience to be gained on that lake from completing the two exploration missions. Additionally, please note that Lone Star Lake has no transfer cost, basic fishing license fee or daily rate. It is thus very easy to complete multiple tiers of the "explorer" mission at Lone Star by repeatedly skipping to the next morning (T button) at no cost. If you do this, you should leave all wearable items at home, including vests, rod cases and keepnets, because they will deteriorate and require maintenance after a thirty day stay if you keep them on.


Lesní Víla (Czech Republic, name means "Forest Villa" in English) is also a home destination for fishing.** I recommend buying an unlimited day basic license as soon as you can. Lesní is a very different place than Lone Star. At first it will probably seem a lot harder to catch fish, which makes sense for a couple of reasons. For one, the European lake is colder than the American one, being at higher latitude and further inland. For another, many of the fish in Europe are not highly predatory. Common carp, probably the most popular "coarse fish" (i.e. not a salmonid, which are gamefish) on the continent, are best caught with bread, corn, dough balls or semolina balls.


Fishing at Lesní, however, is highly worthwhile. It will help you perfect the float fishing technique, because many of the fish are found deep. Use the map key (M button) to pull up a contour map of the lake on your tablet computer. Notice that the maximum depth close to shore actually exceeds your max leader depth (8'2"). The best strategy here is to cast out into the center of the pond and slowly retrieve, pausing frequently to let the leader settle out and c o c k the float. When you pause, you may also need to reverse the retrieve direction and let a little line out to allow the float to straighten out. You will probably find that you catch the most fish when you are close to, but not quite touching, the bottom. However, you are also giving fish at mid-depth a chance at your bait while you search for the bottom. Also consider fishing near lily pads and reedmace (cattails in American English).


*If you are interested, the forks of the Sulphur River in Northern Texas that "Lone Star" Lake is located between are real, although I don't know if any of the farm ponds there are called Lone Star.
**The Czech Republic has many privately owned impoundment fisheries that resemble the one at Lesní.


Balancing Rod and Reel Outfits
Breaking equipment or the line is one of the worst feelings, because it invariably happens on a good-sized fish. To prevent this, make sure that your rod and reel outfit is balanced. The game will warn you if you are making an unbalanced outfit, but won't stop you from doing it. The best method for the beginner is to first take a look at the rod you have in your inventory. What is its line rating in pound test? Then pick a reel that has a max drag setting similar to the rod's strength. Finally, choose a line: monofilament, fluorocarbon or braid (I use braid on float rods - pick the pro kind if you are going after wary fish like carp because it is thinner/less visible to fish). The line should be the weakest part of the rig, but not excessively so. If your line is much weaker than the max drag setting of the reel, you will have to calculate the drag setting to avoid setting it too tight and breaking your line before the drag engages (never set your drag to maximum tension - a full circle - you will break your line). On the other hand, if your line is too strong for the reel, the reel will suffer damage when a big fish peels all of the line off of the drag without encountering sufficient resistance.


Notice also that all of the spinning reels have a number associated with them like 1.4k (1400) or 2000. As the numbers go up, the capacity of the reel spool increases.


Hook Sizes and Baits
Overview of Baits



  
Insect/Worm Baits

  
Red Worms

  
Pinkies (small maggots)*

  
Maggots

  
Caster maggots (maggot pupae)

  
Bloodworms (midge larvae)**

  
Nightcrawler Worms

  
Grasshoppers***

  
Mole Cricket Larvae****

  
Flies

  
Mayflies

  
Leeches

  
Waxworms (bee hive pest larvae)

  
Cockchafer beetle (a European Junebug)

  
Dobsonfly Larvae (hellgrammite)

  
Adult Dobsonflies




*the smallest maggots are called "squats," I think pinkies might be so named because their length is close to the width of the end of the pinky finger


**the smallest bloodworms are called "jokers;" bloodworms are highly effective for mixed species fishing in European waters in-game


***grasshoppers are my personal "go to" bait for medium-size fish of both predatory and non-predatory species that have invertebrates listed in their diet


****more properly called "nymphs" as crickets are hemimetabolous, might represent either the Australian "sandgroper" or the not closely related Gryllotalpid mole crickets of Europe and South America
