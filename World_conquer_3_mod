This category is so warmly welcomed that not only is it made into various famous games, but it is also used as themes such as “Call of duty: World War II”. Personally, we can easily see that war games are well-known for their strategic gameplay and stunning graphics.


In 2025, “World Conqueror 3: World War II”, which is the sequel to “World Conqueror” one and two, was published by EasyTech. Since its origins have such a large fan base, the sequel was warmly welcome on its release date. “World Conqueror 3” is a strategy game that requires a lot of logical thinking as well as brilliant strategies in order to defeat the enemies.


STORY


When in high school, everyone has certainly studied about World War I and II. It is no longer a strange topic, and because of it, the world has its order today. In “World Conqueror 3: World War II”, players will become the commander of the country that they choose and lead their army to conquer the world. Logical thinking and unique strategies are required while playing the game, yet, the most important thing is to feel relaxed and enjoy it.


In this game, players will experience World War II, the Cold War, and Modern Warfare and can feel like they are actually at war. The timeline and the atmosphere are so real that players know what it is like to be in World War II. Do not worry if you know nothing about the war, this game will provide some useful knowledge about it! Do you feel excited yet? Let’s look at some remarkable features of the game!


FEATURES


Understandable and fascinating gameplay


Although “World Conqueror 3” is a strategy game, players do not have to spend a lot of time understanding it. Everything is clearly instructed, and tutorials are shown at the beginning of the game so that players can follow. It can get complicated at first, yet, after a few tries, “World Conqueror 3” becomes less puzzling.


The core of the game is turn-based movement and combat on board. Your mission is to defeat the enemies and win the war. Players will move their weapons to different places to take down specific targets on the map. The control is very simple, all you have to do is tapping on your desired objects on the screen.


Generals and tasks


In “World Conquerors 3”, players will become the leader with a large army to control. There are a diversity of famous generals, and each will oversee one weapon. Players can promote the generals, learn some new skills, and hire more commanders from prestigious Military Academies all over the world. Each general has his own special skills such as damage, speed, etc., and each level needs a specific general.


Besides campaigns, another way to gain coins and different types of currency is to finish missions. If you want a change from doing campaigns all the time, see what missions you have got and complete them. Doing so can earn you coins, which are necessary for upgrading or purchasing new weapons. Here you can hire commanders, purchase resources with medals, or send the commanders into missions; each task requires one general.


During the game


There are in total 32 historical campaigns in three difficulty levels, and 150 military tasks as well as plenty of missions to complete. Each level has three stars to achieve, and each star has its own requirement. Once you earn three stars, you can replay that level, but no medals are awarded. The pause button is on the top right of the corner, you can pause the game whenever you want to.


Towers, weapons as well as generals can be placed anywhere you prefer as long as it is an ideal spot. The game is like chess, you will have to move your weapon to other locations on the map in order to defeat the enemies. Since “World Conqueror 3” is a strategy game, thinking is required.


During the game, besides a land-based army, players can also use air-based support such as fighters, bombers, strategic bombers, or paratroopers to attack further enemies. Guns can be placed and upgraded from the anti-air gun to the anti-air missile. To do so, coins, which can be collected through campaigns and missions, are needed. The level ends when all rivals are defeated.


Contrasting and exciting scripts


There are four different scripts from different ages: Conquer 1939, Conquer 1943, Conquer 1950, and Conquer 1960. Since world patterns change over time, each year has different types of generals, weapons, and scenarios. Players can choose different sides and countries to achieve different awards. Each country is ranked with stars, three are the highest, and one is the lowest regarding generals, resources, and troop strength.


Wonders


There are up to 42 wonders all over and outside the world, from Winter Palace, Big Ben Tower to the Milky Way, the Universe. Wonders can be built using industry, energy, or tech. Each has a different period of time to finish, some take one to two months, some take more than one year. The benefits of constructing wonders are various, players can earn more coins or steels per round, more HP for cities, and so many more. Remember to consider which wonder suits your condition and the place you choose most!


GRAPHIC VISUALS AND SOUND QUALITY


The graphics of “World Conqueror 3” are beautifully designed, each country has a specific color so that players can distinguish between them. Each small detail is carefully made and colored. Weapons look amazingly realistic with true-to-life sound effects. The frame rate is steady, even though the game was created so long ago, no bugs or lags are found during the gameplay.


FINAL THOUGHTS

--Background info & Reccommendations--


-The app was originally configured by another user who placed adware on the app,
but thanks to his or her modifications, world conqueror 3 could now be modified without
being stuck in an eternal loading screen. 
-To eliminate the adware, lucky patcher was downloaded from aptoide to remove all
types of ads. The app may not be fully free of adware when installed on a new mobile
device. 
-When a game is started for the first time, a Russian ad should pop up, just close out
of it and every subsequent time the game tries to "ad" you, the lucky patcher patch will
kill the ad immediately. However, if the ads still pop up and spams adware, it is recommended
to install lucky patcher and re-remove the ads. 
-May not be needed, but it is recommended to install "file manager hd" from google play store",
it is a nice tool to use for (as the name suggests) managing your files.
