GTA 5 cheats, phone numbers and console commands


GTA 5 cheats for PS4, PS5, Xbox and PC, in one place.


GTA 5 cheats and the corresponding GTA 5 cheat codes are a staple of any GTA plathrough at this point, being the easiest way to get straight to the fun - which most of the time means straight to the invincibility, weapons, ammo and of course helicopters.


Below you'll find details for every GTA 5 cheat code available, in a variety of formats: first a list of all GTA 5 cheats and each platform's respective code, console command or phone cheat side by side, split into general cheats and vehicle cheats; and then further down the page are our lists of GTA 5 cheats separated by platform, for ease of use.


For a full list of all PS4 and PS5 GTA 5 cheats, Xbox GTA 5 cheats, PC GTA 5 console commands, or Cell phone cheats and PS3 and Xbox 360 codes then, you've come to the right page. Do note that for money, however, it's confirmed that there's absolutely no specific GTA 5 money cheat - but there are some alternatives. If that's what you're after, we have a guide on how to make money in GTA 5 that'll have you rolling with the elite in no time!

How to enter GTA 5 cheats on PS4, PS5, Xbox, PC, PS3, Xbox 360, and Xbox One


GTA 5 added some interesting ways to input cheats on top of the good old controller button-mashing codes. On consoles, you can input those controller codes or, alternatively, whip out the in-game cell phone to dial in a number that activates the cheat instead.


On PC, you can do either of those things and also use console commands - the commands are actually the words spelled out by the phone numbers, which is a nice touch (giving you things like 1-999-LAWYERUP)!


Here's a quick rundown of how to enter cheats on each platform:



  
PS5, PS4 and PS3 - Follow the button prompts in the tables below on controller, or press Up to bring up the cell phone and call the respective number.

  
Xbox Series, Xbox One and Xbox 360 - Follow the button prompts in the tables below on controller, or press Up to bring up the cell phone and call the respective number.

  
PC - Follow the button prompts in the tables below on controller, or press the Up key to bring up the cell phone and call the respective number, or press the key to the left of 1 on your keyboard (Â¬ in the UK or ~ on a US keyboard) to use console commands. Remember to use all capital letters and hit enter when done.




There is a decent range of cheats available for GTA 5 players, but it's worth noting that some classics are missing - there's no way to spawn yourself a tank for instance, plus no actual, official money cheat - despite what a lot of people will tell you!


For weapons, there is only one cheat - unlike in earlier games, and there's only a short list of vehicles you can get your hands on.


Otherwise, there are a couple of final things to bear in mind: first, you won't be able to unlock achievements or trophies, or get anything other than a Bronze rating on missions, in a session where cheats have been activated. Second, all of these cheats are purely offline only - cheats are disabled in GTA Online, due to the pretty obvious disrupted effect they'd otherwise have!


GTA 5 cheats: weapons, armour, invincibility, wanted level, all general cheat codes


What follows is a complete list of all GTA 5 cheat codes, and how to enter them on PS4, PS5 Xbox and PC - plus the Cell Phone code.

GTA 5 cheats for Xbox Series, Xbox One and Xbox 360: cheat codes and cell phone numbers


Xbox Series, Xbox 360 and Xbox One GTA cheats work in the same way as they do on PlayStation platforms: you can enter them at any point in offline mode by using the controller inputs listed below, or by dialling the cell phone numbers listed next to them.


The only thing to note is that the buttons don't always line up exactly with their counterparts on PlayStation - so just because you have, say, the Invincibility cheat burned into your muscle memory on one platform, that doesn't mean it's the exact same buttons on the other. Double check the list below when in doubt!

GTA 5 cheats for PC: console commands and cell phone numbers


As we mentioned above, cheats on PCs work a little differently to their counterparts on consoles. You can still use a controller to input them - we've used Xbox button names below, as that's the most popular choice of PC gamepad - but otherwise the main ways of inputting them are via the in-game cell phone (again, bring it up in-game and dial the below numbers to use the cheats), or alternatively you can use console commands.


To bring up console commands in GTA, press the "~" key on US keyboards, or the "Â¬" key on UK keyboards (whichever one is in the top left of your keyboard, under the Esc key and to the left of the 1). Then simply type the corresponding command, as it appears (so, in capital letters) in the table below, and hit enter to activate the cheat.

Is there a money cheat in GTA 5?


With the fact you can make yourself invincible, use slow-motion aiming and remove your wanted level, you might be wanting to get unlimited money next.


Though older GTA games offer this, for whatever reason there is no money cheat in GTA 5, even in the single player story mode.


Want easy money? Playing the markets and completing assassinations is the way to go.


Instead, you have to put in the work yourself - and thankfully, we can help with our GTA 5 stock market explainer, which offers a step-by-step breakdown of how you can use stock market assassinations to boost your capital.


It's not the same as a quick and easy GTA 5 money cheat, but at least it's earned 'honestly' - plus, the rewards will stick with you long after you've finished your cheat-based session.


 If you're looking for help with GTA 5 story missions, learn the different outcomes in The Jewel Store Job, The Merryweather Heist, The Big Score and final mission Deathwish. For hijinks out in the open world, there are Strangers and Freaks missions, the military base and spaceship parts to find. Want to explore more beyond the main game? Then play around with GTA 5 cheats, money and stock market and GTA 5 mods.
