nerd Gimkit uses websockets to transfer data between the client and the server. Think of websockets as a tunnel, data can go from the client to the server or the server to the client. 
What this hack does is intercept the data being transferred, record it, and let it continue to the server. 
When you press u , the client sends the saved data directly to the server via the websocket. If the saved data is a correct answer, it will trick the server into giving you money.
