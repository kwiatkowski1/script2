Expansive Library of Voice Changers


Voicemod gives you the freedom to experiment with over 80 distinctive voice filters in Discord. Make people laugh with the Chipmunk or Titan voices. Turn into a musical star using autotune effects with Lilâ€™ Mod, Magic Chords, and more. Try out holiday-themed voices such as Santa, Ghost, and the Crazy Clown. Thereâ€™s something for everyone. Our voices can take a D&D game from standard to epic with ample roleplaying potential! Assign your favorites to keybinds for quick and easy access (and to swap between characters on the fly!). Link them up with your Elgato Stream Deck if youâ€™re feeling extra fancy. Content creators, weâ€™re talking to you!


Create your own voice


Want to get even more creative? Voicemodâ€™s Voicelab feature allows the true voice enthusiast to take their ideas and go wild! With over 15 effects to play with, you can combine and layer them to create the perfect voice filter. Each effect features its own tweaks and sliders, offering you the ability to fine-tune your newest creation. Come up with your own or even mimic existing iconic voices.


Improve your natural voice


Tired of hearing your friends complain about your echo or uneven volume in Discord party chats? Ever wish you could fix it with minimal effort? Our Clean Voice filter can alleviate all your (and your friendsâ€™) woes by cleaning up and enhancing your vocals in a single click. No matter what microphone you use, Clean Voice promises an enhanced audio experience for all your listeners.
