300 million jobs will be replaced by AI. But almost nobody is prepared for this. Here's everything you need to know about AI: 1. Believe it or not, some degree of AI has been present in our lives for at least a decade now. Ever used Google to find a product or get directions to your friends house? Searched for a movie on Netflix? Used Siri on your iPhone? All of these products use AI to help you. 2. But things have started to move really fast since Google invented Transformer models in 2017. I won't go too deep into what a Transformer is (you can Google it), but they basically open up some crazy possibilities in the worlds of language and imagery. Some examples of mind-blowing advances: ‚Ä¢ Uizard can turn your handmade sketches into an app demo. ‚Ä¢ Soundraw IO will generate royalty free music in seconds. ‚Ä¢ Midjourney will let you turn any text into an images. Tools like Github copilot can even help developers write code, while some AI products can now build and design entire apps based on what you tell it to build. 3. We're not far off from a day where AI simply codes an entire product for folks who don't know how to code, which blows the field wide open for anyone who wants to build a technical product. Imagine building a working app without knowing how to write a line of code. 4. But this is just the beginning. AI already outperforms humans on many tasks - like chess and modelling protein structures. In the next few years, we'll see AI beating us on tasks we didn't think were possible - from creating art and movies to answering customer service calls. 5. What happens next? The honest answer is that nobody knows for sure. But it's likely that AI will improve rapidly from here and outperform humans on most tasks. This will make our lives much easier, but also potentially threaten millions of jobs. 6. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. Eliminating mundane tasks people hate can often free them up to focus on higher level or more creative tasks. Imagine being able to delegate the boring parts of your job to an AI and freeing up your time to focus on things you enjoy doing. ____ If you liked this, join Superhuman ‚Äï my weekly newsletter that teaches you how to leverage AI to boost your productivity and accelerate your career: https://lnkd.in/dVQkm5r2

I was sadly advised today of the loss of Pat Quinn my former boss at Kier Building Maintenance (KBM) in the mid 2000s. Pat was great to be around, fiercely passionate about his work and always straight talking. 'Measure twice, cut once' was one of his many pearls of wisdom. It stood him well through his career and mine too when I have followed this simple advice. Pat had a great career before I met him at KBM with senior roles at both LB Hackney and LB Newham. He was an innovator too. For example, he was one of the first to introduce 'bring your daughter to work' initiatives challenging the male dominated environment in direct labour organisations and in building maintenance generally. Pat's family have requested donations to: https://lnkd.in/ecyrB8cA RIP Pat Quinn ‚ù§

I spoke with someone recently who had applied to nearly 800 jobs in the past 6 months since being laid off. His results were. underwhelming. Only 6 total interviews. 2 ended up moving to a panel interview. Most importantly - ZERO offers. üò≤ Much like a doctor would assess a patient's symptoms, I immediately begin a process of diagnosing the issue. In his case, his applications-to-interview ratio was extremely low. üëâ This tells me that his resume is the issue. We reviewed his resume and determined two major issues. 1. The resume was not written to sell him for any particular role. It was written as a list of what he felt were his biggest career accomplishments. and they meant nothing to a potential employer. üí° He needed to begin customizing his resume. 2. He was spending WAY too much time applying for jobs that did not make sense. Either he wasn't qualified for they didn't fit a logical career progression. üí° He needed to cut down on non-value added "panic applying" and focus on more targeted jobs. Because he was wasting his time with a "throw it against the wall" approach, and not maximizing his efforts on the roles that were truly a good fit for him, it was no wonder his results were so lackluster. With a careful resume overhaul, and a revised approach to his job search process, his results picked up. 35 applications netting 11 job interviews. 5 onsites, and 2 offers. All from some relatively simple approach changes. If you're struggling with your job search, maybe it's time to re-evaluate your approach too? More on his interview strategy later. __________________________________________ If you want to learn how to write a resume that gives you the best chance of landing that big interview, check out Resume Rockefuel - Link in my bio under the "featured articles" tab, or on my website. #resumewriting #careercoach #careeradvice #jobsearchadvice
