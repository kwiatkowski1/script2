ES File Explorer APK for Android


Anyone that needs a versatile file and application manager will love this program. It has a sleek interface and makes it simple to track and understand everything that’s stored on an Android device. It works well and doesn’t require a computer connection.


Track and manage your files


ES File Explorer searches through all the files on your Android device and puts them on display through an easy to understand interface. It can categorize and filter these pieces of data, as well. There’s an option to order the lists from largest to smallest files. This is useful for removing large files that you might not be using anymore.

The issue that stands out, though, is the heavy use of advertising. Anything you do in the app will have an ad rearing its ugly head at some point.


Ease of use
