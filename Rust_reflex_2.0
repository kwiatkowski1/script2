Rust: NVIDIA Reflex Gives Players A Free Upgrade, Reducing System Latency By Up To 38%


In competitive games, higher FPS and refresh rates (Hz) reduce system latency, delivering more opportunities for your inputs to end up on screen. Even small reductions in latency have an impact on performance. Powerful GPUs, high refresh displays, and tuned game settings can help gamers unlock their full potential. To further improve your performance on the virtual field there’s now also NVIDIA Reflex Low Latency Mode, a free update for many popular competitive games that reduces system latency. Acquire targets faster, react quicker, and increase aim precision simply by enabling NVIDIA Reflex in a game’s settings.


NVIDIA Reflex: Available Today In Rust


Facepunch Studios’ phenomenally successful Rust attracts ever more gamers to its high-stakes servers month after month, where everything and everyone is a threat to your survival. Sleep with one eye open, because a raid can occur at any time, and keep your head on a swivel when exploring, resource harvesting, and stalking enemy players. With just a few hits being deadly, you want the fastest possible response times, your shots to land on the target, and your actions to occur that bit quicker than the enemy’s. Enter NVIDIA Reflex Low Latency Mode, which is available from 11am PT today in Rust for anyone with a GeForce GTX 900 Series or newer GPU.
