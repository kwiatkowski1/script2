SHiFT


SHiFT is an out-of-game reward system using a 25-character alphanumeric code that, when inputted into Borderlands 2, or Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, can be used to unlock limited time offers within the game. SHiFT Codes are distributed periodically through social media services and range from hot temporary give-aways with a code expiry within hours, to larger event offers, such as for Halloween. PC codes can only be redeemed on the Steam version of the games. The majority of codes grant Golden Keys, or unlock new character skins for the Quick Change system, however SHiFT codes for character equipment have also been released on rare occasions.


The maximum number of Golden Keys that are displayed by a SHiFT account is 255. Acquiring one more key will reset the count to 1. Details on maximum number of keys can be found on the talk page.
