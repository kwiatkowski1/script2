Original Prison Break Script: The Pilot


OMG when I tell you I was excited to see this, you can't even understand! I love SpoilerTV and for good reason: today they bring us the pilot script for Prison Break! Relive the magic - on paper (well, on the Internet), then pull out your DVD & watch it! Click on the second pic to see the entire script!
