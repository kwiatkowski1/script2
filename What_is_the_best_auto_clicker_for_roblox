These are the best autoclickers to use in Roblox


Autoclickers are a fast way to speed up grinding in Roblox, and these free options are the best for the job.


Some Roblox games require constant attention from the player, demanding occasional inputs to stay active. Others require idle time away from the game, which can slow down progress. The optimal thing to do is sit at the computer and click the mouse as fast as you can. In practice, it’s incredibly boring. Many players prefer to use a program to simulate constant clicks. If you’re looking for such a tool, here are the best free autoclickers that work in Roblox.


IO Auto Clicker is an easy autoclicker for Roblox


IO Auto Clicker is one of the best autoclickers when it comes to ease of use and customization. It has a colorful and simple interface with an optional night mode, which no other Roblox autoclickers offer.


IO Auto Clicker boasts a useful click interval setting which can determine the interval for clicking. To get around bot detection, users can select the random click option and set two different time intervals for click generation. It can generate unlimited single or double clicks for the left, right and middle buttons. Lastly, players can turn it on and off at a whim with a customizable hotkey.


Most autoclickers require either an initial starting click or specific screen coordinates, but IO Auto Clicker allows users to use either technique to aim their autoclicks.

In addition, the program features a timer that can shut off the autoclicker after a determined amount of time or clicks.


OP Auto Clicker has the full set of standard functions with unlimited clicks for the left and right mouse buttons. It also has a nifty double-click feature for special purposes. Current Location mode generates clicks where the cursor of the mouse is pointing. Pick Location can redirect it somewhere else on the screen.

Are Roblox players allowed to use autoclickers?


Auto Clickers are not allowed in Roblox, and you can get banned for using it if your auto clicker gets detected.


Autoclickers are generally considered a form of cheating by most games, and many developers have responded with anti-cheat measures. Many games including Roblox can check the player’s inputs and detect oddly consistent or inhumanly fast clicks. This is why some of the programs above offer randomized or multiple click timings. If the game detects these programs, it could lead to temporary or even permanent account bans.


In addition, there is the possibility of accidentally downloading a malicious program while searching for the best free Roblox autoclicker. All the links on this page are safe downloads with no risk of viruses, but other download sources may be malware in disguise.
