ROBLOX Kill command to kill specified player


I want to make a command that would kill a player you specify.. Let's say I type: kill/Paul. Now I want to kill the player with the name Paul. This is my command Script:


local player = . game.Players.PlayerAdded:connect(function(player) --this gets the player that connected player.Chatted:connect(function(message) --this function executes when the player type into chat --commands are here if player.Name == "TominoCZ" or player.Name == "nathancain" or player.Name == "block100000" then if message == "kill/me" then player.Character.Head:remove() end if message == "ff/me" then if player.Character:findFirstChild("ForceField") then player.Character.ForceField:Destroy() end Instance.new("ForceField").Parent = player.Character end if message == "unff/me" then if player.Character:findFirstChild("ForceField") then player.Character.ForceField:Destroy() end end end end) end) 


Now you can see that I already have a command that will kill the play that executed it. But how can I kill a different player by specifying the player's name after the "kill/"? This command script might look too long or not too pro, but atleast I know and understand what it does. So any ideas?
