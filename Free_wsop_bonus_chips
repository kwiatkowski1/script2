Like other online poker rooms, World Series of Poker online has multiple welcome offers to entice new customers. This includes a $25 no deposit bonus, a $25 bonus with any deposit, and an additional 100% first deposit match, worth up to $1,000.


$25 No Deposit Bonus


When signing up to claim the WSOP no deposit bonus for $25 free, the money is available immediately. You can use it in low-stakes cash games, sit and go‚Äôs or multi-table tournaments. The bonus lets you try WSOP.com without having to deposit and risk your own money.


100% Deposit Bonus + $25 Free


When you‚Äôre ready to make a deposit, WSOP will greet you with two separate bonuses both tied to your first deposit.


First, regardless of the amount of your deposit, you will receive a $25 bonus. Only a minimum deposit of $10 is required to receive these free funds. 


However, you may want to deposit more than the minimum as new players also receive a 100% deposit match bonus up to $1,000. That means if your first deposit is $100, for instance, you will receive both $25 for the first part of the bonus, and an additional $100 for the match bonus. 


In this case, you‚Äôll need to meet playthrough requirements to claim the bonus. Players on WSOP.com accumulate action player points as they play. You receive APPs whenever you play a raked hand in a cash game or pay a fee when entering a sit-and-go or tournament.


As you play, you‚Äôll unlock $5 of bonus money for every 50 APPs you collect. Also, the offer has a time limit. Once you make your first deposit, you have 90 days to satisfy the playthrough requirement and unlock the full bonus. Overall, the deposit match bonus rivals what other sites offer and can provide a nice bankroll boost when you start out on the site.


Welcome Week Freerolls


WSOP.com has one other offer for new players, Welcome Week Freerolls. This promotion is also tied to players making a first deposit on the site.


Once players make an initial deposit of at least $10, they are then eligible to enter one freeroll tournament on each day for the next seven days. These tournaments happen each night and currently feature $100 prize pools. You get to play seven of these Welcome Week Freerolls, one each day for the first week after making a deposit.


In addition to a variety of cash games, sit and go‚Äôs, and multi-table tournaments, WSOP.com frequently runs popular tournament series on its sites. These can include special ring and bracelet events that often attract big turnouts and feature large prize pools.


WSOP Online Poker Promotions


The WSOP site also offers a variety of ongoing promotions across all of its sites. These vary depending on which state you are in, but frequently include the following:



  
Freerolls

  
Tournaments with added cash prizes

  
Reload bonuses

  
Leaderboards

  
Sweepstakes drawings




Freeroll tournaments take a variety of forms. With some, anyone can play. Others require players to have a certain number of APPs or satisfy some other criteria to play, but there is no entry fee like in other tournaments. The freerolls award either cash or tournament tickets.


Sometimes WSOP.com will run tournaments for which it adds cash to the prize pools. These still cost money to play, but the prize pools are a little bigger thanks to the added cash. Like other online poker rooms, WSOP.com also offers occasional reload bonuses. These work like the deposit match bonus, except they are available to everyone and not just new players. Make a deposit and receive a 100% matching bonus up to a certain maximum (say, $500). Like the deposit match bonus, these bonuses will have a playthrough requirement.


WSOP.com additionally hosts leaderboards for which top performers win cash, tournament tickets and other prizes. For example, you will find sit and go and BLAST leaderboards. Also on its NJ and NV sites, WSOP has featured a yearlong Player of the Year Leaderboard. Players accumulate POY points all year for cashing in tournaments, and the winner gets $10,000 cash, $1,500 in tournament tickets and a WSOP ring.


The WSOP site will sometimes also offer sweepstakes for its players to enter. For example, it has had a drawing in which the winner received an entry into the $10,000 WSOP Main Event in Las Vegas.


WSOP Poker Rewards Loyalty Program


WSOP.com introduced a newly designed loyalty program in 2018, calling it the WSOP Poker Rewards program. When you sign up for an account and start playing, you automatically enroll in the program.


WSOP Poker Rewards works like most loyalty programs that use a tier-based system. The amount you play on the site determines your rewards. The more you play, the more cash you get back.


Click to join WSOP and get up to $1,050 in welcome bonuses!


Action Player Points & Poker Rewards Levels


Whenever you play a cash game, a sit and go or a tournament on the WSOP site, you accumulate action player points. The APPs are calculated according to how much rake you contribute in cash games or how much in fees you pay when playing sit and go‚Äôs and tournaments.


The number of APPs you collect in a month determines your Poker Rewards loyalty status. Your status level then determines the exchange rate for turning your points into cash. You accrue APPs at the following rates:



  
Cash games: 2 APPs for every $1 a player contributes to the rake in hands played.

  
Tournaments and sit and go‚Äôs: 2 APPs for every $1 in fees.




For instance, if you play a $215 tournament in which $200 goes to the prize pool and $15 counts as a fee, you earn 30 APPs. At the end of each month, WSOP.com adds up all of the APPs you‚Äôve earned that month to determine your loyalty status. Here are the different Poker Rewards levels and the number of APPs each requires:



  
Player: 0 to 199.99 APPs in a month

  
Bronze: 200 to 749.99 APPs in a month

  
Silver: 750 to 1,499.99 APPs in a month

  
Elite: 1,500+ APPs in a month

  
Champions Club: 20,000+ APPs in a year




Converting APPs To Cash


In order to collect cash back, you need to convert your APPs to WSOP points and then exchange those for cash. Your loyalty status affects the conversion rate as follows:



  
Player: 1 APP = 1 WSOP point

  
Bronze: 1 APP = 4 WSOP points

  
Silver: 1 APP = 10 WSOP points

  
Elite: 1 APP = 12.5 WSOP points

  
Champions Club: 1 APP = 16 WSOP points




Once you‚Äôve converted APPs to WSOP points, you can then redeem those points at a rate of 100 WSOP points for $1. When you do, the cash appears in your account right away with no restrictions. You can withdraw the money or use it to play more games.


The WSOP Poker Rewards program improves on the site‚Äôs earlier loyalty program in which players had to move up levels before they could start accruing cash back. With this program, even those playing at lower stakes and for less volume can start earning the payouts, and those in the middle and upper tiers can earn considerable rewards.


It‚Äôs worth noting also that players who have Caesars Rewards accounts with Caesars Entertainment can also connect those accounts to their WSOP.com profiles. They then can earn Caesars tier credits right along with their APPs at a rate of one credit per point.


WSOP.com Nevada


When WSOP launched an online poker site in Nevada in September 2013, it was one of the first legal, real money online poker sites in the US. WSOP NV is operated by Caesars Interactive Entertainment. Caesars is the site‚Äôs land-based partner in the state, while 888 Holdings is its tech partner. The Nevada Gaming Commission oversees online poker in the state.


Initially, WSOP NV was ring-fenced, meaning Nevada players could only play against others in the state. Eventually, a multi-state agreement allowed WSOP NV to share players with WSOP NJ as well as the 888 Poker site in Delaware starting in 2018.


Join WSOP Nevada here and use bonus code: 25BONUS for up to $1,050 total.


WSOP.com New Jersey


WSOP.com launched an online poker room in New Jersey in November 2013. WSOP NJ is operated by Caesars in conjunction with 888 Holdings, with Caesars Atlantic City as its land-based partner. The site is licensed and regulated by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement.


Like the Nevada site, New Jersey players at WSOP initially only played against one another. As noted, since 2018 players on WSOP NJ have been able to compete against those at WSOP NV and the 888 Poker Delaware site.


Join WSOP New Jersey here and use bonus code: 25BONUS for up to $1,050 total.


WSOP.com Pennsylvania


Pennsylvania first legalized online gambling in 2017, and after a couple of years the first online casinos and poker sites began to appear.


In September 2020, the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board approved the application of Caesars‚Äô online partner 888 Holdings for an interactive gaming manufacturer license. PA also requires online poker sites to have a land-based partner. In the case of WSOP.com, that partner is Harrah‚Äôs Philadelphia Casino and Racetrack.


WSOP Pennsylvania launched in July 2021 with the same bonus offers and promotions as Nevada and New Jersey. They did however have a new poker client, using the same Poker 8 platform available at 888 sites in Europe. This updated, modern software will soon be introduced at WSOP‚Äôs other online sites as well.


Join WSOP Pennsylvania here and use bonus code: 25BONUS for up to $1,050 total.


WSOP.com Michigan


Michigan first legalized online gambling in late 2019. The first online casinos and poker sites went live in the state in January 2021. In Michigan, online poker is regulated by the Michigan Gaming Control Board.


As in other states, online poker sites need to partner with a land-based, licensed gambling entity to operate in the state. Caesars‚Äô agreement to purchase William Hill may provide WSOP.com the avenue in needs to come to Michigan. In early 2020, William Hill made an agreement with the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians in Michigan, which could facilitate the launch of WSOP MI in the near future.


WSOP MI went live at the tail end of March 2022. Just like Pennsylvania, Michigan players currently are fenced in. This means that they can only play against other WSOP players in the state. The hope is that in the near future Michigan users will be able to play against players in Nevada, New Jersey and hopefully Pennsylvania as well.


Join WSOP Michigan here and use bonus code: 25BONUS for up to $1,050 total.


Signing Up For An Account At WSOP.com


To register at the WSOP site, you need to be at least 21 years old, regardless of your state. Start by visiting the website and downloading the software either to your computer or mobile device. The site will automatically detect which state you are in as well as what kind of device you are using.


You can play at WSOP.com on either a desktop or laptop computer (PC or Mac) or a mobile device, either Apple or Android. Once you‚Äôve downloaded and opened the site, you can then register an account. You‚Äôll have to enter some personal information:


You‚Äôll additionally choose a username and password, and set up a security question. Providing this information helps WSOP.com know you are who you say you are. It also helps regulators ensure the site‚Äôs integrity and your security when playing on it.


WSOP Website Features


The WSOP.com software runs smoothly and offers players an easy-to-navigate interface. Players visiting the site will immediately encounter the familiar WSOP logo and red-and-black theme, making the site aesthetically pleasing in addition to being intuitive.


Along the top, you will find tabs showing the available games sorted into categories. There is a ‚Äúquick seat‚Äù option as well that lets you skip the lobby and grab a seat right away at your preferred game type, table and stakes.


The lobby is quite detailed but easy enough to use. When it comes to cash games, players can see at a glance what is happening at each active table. Here is the information you‚Äôll find:



  
Game type

  
Stakes

  
Players seated

  
Average pot size

  
Percentage of players seeing flop

  
Hands played per hour

  
Players on wait list




Heading over to the tournament lobby, you‚Äôll also find a lot of information about what is available, including game type, buy-in, players registered and tournament status. You can filter the lobby however you like so as to highlight preferred games. There‚Äôs also a ‚ÄúBeginners‚Äù tab that does this filtering for you, presenting just a few low-stakes cash games, sit and go‚Äôs and tournaments.


There are numerous ways to customize settings. You can resize tables, make them tile or cascade when multi-tabling, show your folded cards, automatically activate the time bank, employ various shortcut keys and more. There‚Äôs a note-taking feature, as well. Chat was once available, but the site has that disabled.


The site has updated its features only occasionally over the years since WSOP.com first launched in Nevada and New Jersey in 2013. As a result, the look and feel may appear a little dated to some players. Still, the site works well and is more than adequate when it comes to being able to find cash games and register for tournaments, as well as for actual gameplay.


WSOP Poker App


As noted above, you can play WSOP.com on a mobile device by downloading the app. The World Series of Poker app contains many of the same features as the desktop client (though not all), and is available both for iOS and Android.


The app does not allow players to multi-table. Also, the app only offers Hold‚Äôem games, which means players cannot play Omaha or seven-card stud on the app. These are significant drawbacks, although the new Poker 8 client (discussed below) improves the situation considerably.


Game Selection At WSOP Online


WSOP.com offers a nice variety of cash games, sit and go‚Äôs and tournaments.


Cash Games


When it comes to cash games, WSOP.com has Texas Hold‚Äôem (no limit and fixed limit), Omaha (pot limit, pot limit hi-lo and fixed limit hi-lo) and seven card stud (high only and hi-lo). As is the case everywhere, No Limit Texas Hold‚Äôem is by far the most popular game, so that‚Äôs where most of the action is.


To give an idea of the range of stakes, here is what players in New Jersey currently see when they log in to the WSOP NJ site:



  
No Limit Hold‚Äôem, Pot Limit Hold‚Äôem: $0.01/$0.02 to $200/$400

  
Fixed Limit Hold‚Äôem: $0.05/$0.10 to $200/$400

  
Pot Limit Omaha: $0.01/$0.02 to $25/$50

  
Pot Limit Omaha Hi-Lo: $0.05/$0.10 to $5/$10

  
Fixed Limit Omaha Hi-Lo: $0.05/$0.10 to $30/$60

  
Seven card stud: $0.02/$0.04 and $0.05/$0.10

  
Seven card stud hi-lo: $0.02/$0.04 and $0.05/$0.10




What stakes are active obviously depends on the player pool and who is online at the time.


Sit And Go‚Äôs & BLAST


WSOP.com features sit and go tournaments, with stakes starting at $0.25 and going as high as $200. Games available include NLHE, PLO and PLO8. There are heads-up sit and go‚Äôs, six-handed ones and nine-handed ones. You‚Äôll also find different speeds (regular, turbo and super turbo). The stakes and games that are available depends on what players want to play.


WSOP.com also features BLAST tournaments, a spin and go-style lottery sit and go at super turbo speed. These timed tournaments are four-handed, and when the clock expires, players automatically go all in each hand until someone wins. Stakes go from $0.10 to $30, with the largest jackpots at 10,000 times the buy-in. That means a possible prize of $300,000 for a $30 BLAST game.


Tournaments


The World Series of Poker is synonymous with tournaments, so it‚Äôs no surprise to see tournaments prominently featured on WSOP.com. No matter what state you‚Äôre in, the site consistently offers a variety of multi-table tournaments ranging from freerolls and $1 buy-in events up to $500 weekly tournaments.


WSOP.com also frequently hosts tournament series, including WSOP Circuit series. When the World Series of Poker is playing in Las Vegas, there are WSOP bracelet events on WSOP.com as well. These frequently attract a lot of interest, creating sizable fields and large prize pools.


The great majority of tournaments on WSOP.com are NLHE, although you‚Äôll see PLO events sprinkled in as well. There is a wide selection of tournament formats, including deep-stacked tourneys, short-handed ones, knock-outs (with bounties), rebuys, turbos and super turbos. Larger tournaments nearly always feature satellites, as do many smaller ones.


Most of WSOP.com‚Äôs scheduled tournaments have guaranteed prize pools, which means you can be certain the prize pool will be a minimum amount no matter how many players register.


Looking at WSOP NV and WSOP NJ (for example), regular tournaments include the following:



  
Daily tournaments such as the $7,000 Daily Rebuy with a $7K guaranteed prize pool.

  
Tuesday tournaments with $35,000 and $50,000 guaranteed prize pools.

  
Saturday tournaments with $10,000 and $25,000 guaranteed prize pools.

  
Sunday tournaments with buy-ins ranging from $7.77 to $500 and guaranteed prize pools from $1,500 to $100,000.




New Features Of The Poker 8 client


As noted, WSOP PA marked the US debut of the Poker 8 software, which represents a considerable upgrade. Featuring a darker color scheme and more modern look and design, the new client features a number of improvements including an easier-to-navigate lobby, a better hand replayer, and different avatars, sound effects, and animations.


Even better, the new platform enables multi-day and multi-flight tournaments as well as progressive knockout tournaments.


The mobile client has even more advantages, the most significant being the ability to multi-table. On the old client, players could only play a single table at time. On the new one, players can play up to four tables at once. The mobile app also features Omaha games, which are not available on the old version.


WSOP PA launched with the new Poker 8 client, and when the site goes live in Michigan it will do so as well. Meanwhile, both WSOP NV and WSOP NJ continue with the older client, although plans are for those sites to change over to Poker 8 as well soon.


Deposit & Cashout Options


When it comes to banking, WSOP.com offers a number of methods both to fund your account and to withdraw money for cashout. After creating an account, click ‚Äúcashier‚Äù and follow the instructions from there for depositing or withdrawing. Depositing methods can vary by state, but usually include these options:


Depositing at the casino cage means finding a Caesars-affiliated casino in your state that allows you to do so. For example, in New Jersey you can fund your account at Caesars Atlantic City. Meanwhile, in Nevada, there are several casinos where you can perform your banking, including Caesars Palace, Harrah‚Äôs and the Rio All-Suite Hotel and Casino.


The minimum deposit is $10. The maximum amount varies according to the method you use.


When it comes to withdrawing funds, there are fewer options. Here is what tends to be available:


When withdrawing for the first time, you‚Äôll have to go through a verification process determined by the method you use. That process might take a few days or even up to two weeks such as when verifying a bank account. After that, the wait times are shorter, although sometimes it still takes a few days for processing. There are minimums when withdrawing, too, which depend on the method.


WSOP Customer Service


The WSOP website has an online help center that is essentially a detailed FAQ section covering most topics and common queries.


WSOP online poker additionally offers email and phone support. Each state has its own email and phone contacts. Response times to emails vary, but the site promises to reply within 72 hours. Phone support typically is available from 8 a.m. to 12 a.m.


Players can also call on WSOP.com‚Äôs live chat support via either the desktop client or app. Generally live chat is only available a limited number of hours each day; for example, WSOP NJ offers it from 3-11 p.m.


All in all, WSOP.com offers an inviting and competitive online poker room in each of the states where it operates, making it a great option for players in those locations.
