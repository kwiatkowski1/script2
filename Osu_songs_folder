osu! doesn't always recognize folders dragged into Songs [confirmed]


A few months ago I uninstalled osu! because I needed computer space, I've now re-downloaded it and copy and pasted the folder with all my songs/beatmaps on this side of the computer. Osu doesn't seem to recognize them even when I drag and drop and I'm assuming its because I don't have a certain file? I would dislike to have to download all of them again because I have a lot of songs. My friend sent me her's and she has 90+ songs. I extracted them and osu still didn't recognize them. As I said before, I would hate to have to re-download the songs. Can someone help me?


How to replicate:

1. Have an existing beatmap in Songs folder
2. Drag it out of the songs folder (might not be necessary as long as you have a similar song folder to drag back in)
3. Without refreshing, delete the beatmap from the ingame menu
4. Place the folder back in
5. No amount of refreshing will get that folder to detect in the song list after this happens.


I guess dragging folders from an old song folder into a new song folder after uninstalling has the same result.
