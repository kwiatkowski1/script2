Dying Light 2: How to Save Your Game


Given the sheer amount of quests you’ve got to complete in Dying Light 2, chances are you’re going to spend a lot of time exploring its world ridden with the undead. Unless you’re settling in for a serious marathon session, you’re probably going to want to know how to save your game in Dying Light 2. This isn’t just for when you need to take a break, but it can also be handy to make save points along the way in case you make a bad decision or really screw something up.


Saving Your Game in Dying Light 2


Dying Light 2 uses an auto-save system to record your progress as you make your way through the game.


This kicks in fairly often during quests, normally once you’ve completed an objective or have just finished watching a cutscene. We generally found that the game did a solid job of saving our progress regularly enough so there was no noticeable loss of progress.


To try and ‘force’ the auto-save, you can also press Options on PS5, Menu on Xbox, or Esc on PC and then select ‘Quit Game.’


Can You Manually Save Your Game?


Unfortunately, no, there’s no option to manually save your game in Dying Light 2, at least within the settings.


The best way we’ve found to trigger an auto-save is to fast travel to a location on your map, or to sleep in a bed to the next day/night phase. By doing this, you’re forcing a major change in the game, and so a save will be triggered.


Then, you can quit out and take a break, or just carry on with your adventure knowing that your save file is all up-to-date.


That’s everything you need to know on how to save in Dying Light 2. For more tips, tricks and guides, head over to our wiki or see more of our coverage on the game below.


Dying Light 2: Save Game PC Location Guide


Dying Light 2 is a big game. Maybe not exactly 500 hours big, but there are a lot of side quests that disappear after a certain point, and some decisions aren't easy. That's not to mention multiple endings. With all of that in mind, you may be wondering how to find your save files to return to certain portions without having to start over completely.


Below, we cover all of the possible save game locations for Dying Light 2 on PC, so you can regularly back up your progress. But do note that this only applies to the PC version of the game, which is available in both Steam and Epic Games. You cannot do this on PlayStation or Xbox just yet, though Techland is working to implement the functionality.


Dying Light 2 Steam Save File Locations


Remember that Steam doesn't always save game folders with the exact title of the game. In this case, Steam can store all Dying Light 2 save files in the "534380" folder on your PC.


You can simply search your hard drive for this folder, or use the following paths, where Dying Light 2 save files are stored:



  
\Steam\userdata\[USERID]\534380\remote\out\

  
C:\Users\User\Documents\dying light 2\out\save_backups

  
C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Local\DyingLight2\Saved\

  
C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\DyingLight2\Saved\




One of these folders will surely contain all of your save files. So just copy the entire folder and store it on a different drive.


It is also advisable to turn on the cloud storage on Steam by following these steps:



  
Open Steam.

  
Go to the Steam menu in the top right.

  
Select the "Settings" option.

  
Go to the "Cloud" tab.

  
Check the "Enable Steam Cloud Synchronization" option.

  
Press "OK" to confirm.




Dying Light 2 Epic Games Save File Locations


Epic Games usually stores files under the "DL2" or "DyingLight2" folder on your PC.


Here is the list of all possible save files locations for Dying Light 2:



  
C:\Users\[USERNAME]\Documents\My Games\DyingLight2\Saved\SaveGames\

  
C:\Users\[USERNAME]\Saved Games\

  
C:\Users\[USERNAME]\Documents\My Games

  
C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Local\DyingLight2\Saved\




Epic Games also recommends utilizing cloud storage for save files:



  
Start the Epic Games launcher app.

  
Click on your profile icon at the top right corner.

  
Select the "Settings" option.

  
Check "Enable Cloud Saves" option.
