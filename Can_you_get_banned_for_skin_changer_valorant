Is skin changer bannable?


the skins are too expensive and i want to have fun playin the game but without skins or a knife the game for me dont see that funny etc anyone knows?


no skins = not fun. The absolute state of zoomers


Plz itâ€™s only us boomers that can afford skins.


Epic fortnite skin moment!!


If only valorant had a bakees mod (rocket league) equivalent


suprised they dont have something like bakkesmod for valorant its not like it gives you an advantage its all cosmetics


Tf you talking about. The game experience is literally the same, arguably better, without skins.


skins make you play better idk how but its in your mind


Probably not because of how riot is greedy about money and how they want you to feel skins as some sort of "premium" purchase


I'm also wondering the same, I would like it if there is a skin changer like in League, which isn't bannable, to exist in Valorant, or a way to earn Valorant points at least. I mean the game is still fun without skins, but it would be interesting to see some skins in person.


is ur ip will get banned or just the account really want to have an skin
