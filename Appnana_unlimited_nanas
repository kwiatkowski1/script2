AppNana App Review – Is It Legit & Worth Using?


posted on April 2, 2023 This post may contain affiliate links. Please read our disclaimer for more information.


Playing video games is something you may have tried at some point in your life. It’s a fun way to kick back and complete certain challenges alone or with friends.


Nowadays, video games are so popular that people can actually make money playing video games!


If you’ve ever seen full-time Twitch streamers, Youtube gamers, or eSports professionals, you’ll know exactly what I’m talking about.


However, making money online with gaming isn’t only available to these big name gaming stars.


Thanks to a rise of apps that pay you for playing games, you can earn extra cash and free gift cards for trying new mobile games.


If you’ve ever tried apps like Mistplay or AppStation, you may have stumbled across AppNana, another mobile gaming app that pays you to play.


Be sure to stick around until the end of this AppNana review to find out if it’s worth a spot on your mobile device!

Rewarded Play: One of my favorite ways to play Android games for gift card rewards!




What is AppNana?


AppNana is a free app available on IOS and Android that allows you to earn gift cards for playing mobile games. The idea behind it is simple. You download games, play them for a while, and earn points which can later be redeemed for gift cards.


AppNana has over 100,000 reviews on the Google Play store and is currently rated at 4.4 stars (out of 5).


Plus, the fact that AppNana is available on IOS is rather unique since most mobile game apps that pay are Android-only.


Now, keep in mind, apps like AppNana aren’t going to make you rich. It takes a long time to actually get any worthwhile rewards.


However, if you enjoy playing mobile games anyway, then it could be worth downloading because you’re basically earning free money by doing something you’d be doing anyways.


How Does AppNana Work?


If you want to earn rewards with AppNana, the process works in 5 simple steps:



  
Install the app & sign up.

  
Download new games and play.

  
Watch videos.

  
Earn points.

  
Cash out.




I tested out AppNana to see how the app works and to explore the kinds of games you can play to earn rewards. Overall, the app was very easy to use.


Time to explain each step in a bit more detail!


1. Install & Sign Up


To download AppNana, head over to appnana.com and make an account. They only require an email and password.


If you’re on the Google Play store, you can search for AppNana and you’ll be able to download it from there.


If you’re on IOS, you’ll need to download “AppJoy Nana” from the App Store. The website can also redirect you there if you’re not sure you’ve found the right app.


Immediately after registering, you’ll receive a welcome bonus of 10,000 Nanas (their version of points).


Once you’ve downloaded the right app, you can move on to the next step which is actually playing the games…


2. Download New Games & Play


Some of these mobile gaming apps that pay you to play will grant you points based on the amount of time you’ve played the game. This method sounds nice, and essentially turns the time you spending games into a humble source of passive income.


However, one important thing to note about apps like AppNana is that your points per minute usually start to dwindle shortly after playing.


This means that apps might pay well at the start but then start to dwindle until you try new games.


Thankfully, on AppNana, each game has a different requirement that you must complete in order to earn the points.


For example, one game might say “reach 5 million mighty points to earn a reward” and another might say “play at least 5 minutes to earn credits”.


As you can see, some games require time while others require an actual achievement to be unlocked.


To actually start playing, all you have to do is browse a list of AppNana games under the “Get Nanas” section and complete whatever requirements are requested of you.


We’ll cover AppNana’s games list in just a tad, but let’s cover the other earning options and how to cash out as well.


3. Watch Videos


Playing video games isn’t the only way to earn rewards, unlike most other apps in this space.


You can help boost your Nanas by watching videos and ads on the app. However, these videos are basically ads which can be quite annoying.


Plus, you usually only get somewhere between 5-10 Nanas per video. For context, the average game on AppNana gets you a few thousand Nanas!


It’s not the fastest nor the more enjoyable way to earn more points, but it lets you earn money on autopilot and can help you cash out a little bit faster.


4. Earn Points


Again, this app isn’t going to make you rich and the amount of points you earn will not help you cash out every single day.


The first few games you download and play will reward you with an average of 15,000 Nanas per game. The highest being 175,000 points (but the achievement can take days).


As you play more and more games, the amount of points you earn is going to get lower and lower.


At that point, you’re going to have to play a lot of different games often in order to feel like you’re actually earning enough Nanas.


After playing for a while, you’ll have enough Nanas to either download games that normally cost money, or you can redeem them for gift cards.


Pro Tip: Keep an eye out for achievement opportunities since these missions usually pay way more than just earning Nanas per minute. Even though they take a while, if the mission is for a game you like, this is a fun way to earn some rewards.


5. Cash Out


The cash out minimum is around 30,000 Nanas to redeem a reward. For reference, 30,000 Nanas gets you a $1 Amazon gift card, so you need a lot of points to redeem a small reward.


Most reviews have claimed that they do actually receive their gift card within 48 hours (that’s AppNanas promise) so at least it’s legit.


However, just know that AppNana won’t make you rich: this is just a fun and humble side hustle if you like mobile games.


Is AppNana Legit?


Yes, AppNana is legit app and pays you with free gift cards for playing new mobile games. However, common complaints about the app are that it takes a very long time to cash out because the earning potential is so low.


The app does send you gift cards if you earn enough points. And there are tons of games and rewards options to choose from.


There’s also payment proof online from various Reddit users who have cashed out, and AppNana pays rewards within a few days normally.


However, the earning potential is extremely low and it takes way too long to earn just $2 worth of rewards!


How Much Does AppNana Pay?


It’s unlikely that you’re going to make much money using this app. AppNana has a very low hourly earning potential, and you might be able to earn a free gift card after a few weeks or months of playing games.


Remember, a $1 Amazon gift card costs 30,000 Nanas. The average player is likely to earn less than that everyday.


In summary, this isn’t going to cover your rent, grocery bills, or even a lunch once a week.


You need to truly enjoy playing these mobile games, whether you make money or not. That’s the only real way you’re going to sustain your earnings.


AppNana Rewards Options


Your rewards options are available to you under the “Rewards” section of the app.


There are 3 main rewards options in AppNana:


Again, AppNana is a bit different here since most gaming apps just offer free gift cards.


However, I will admit that the lack of PayPal cash is a downside for AppNana’s rewards.


You can use your points to get in-app purchases that would normally cost money. That way, you can save on games you already enjoy playing.


Similarly, if you’ve always wanted to buy a mobile game but didn’t want to spend the money, you can use the points towards that as well.


Other than those scenarios, your best option is definitely going for some free gift cards.


There are a ton of AppNana gift card options:



  
Amazon

  
Itunes

  
Steam codes

  
Xbox

  
Playstation

  
GTA Shark Cards

  
Fifa

  
NBA 2K

  
NFL

  
Nintendo

  
League of Legends




Those are just a few of the rewards options available on the app!


If you’re a fan of gaming, it might be useful to cut back on some of these purchases by using points instead.


AppNana Games List


Alright, time for one of the most important parts of our AppNana review: the types of games you can play.


After all, you really need to like the games you’re playing for AppNana to be worth it since the earning potential is on the low side.


When you head over to the “Get Nanas” section of the app, you’ll find a list of games along with an option to watch videos and unlock other offers.


Here’s a list of games on AppNana:



  
Forge of Empires

  
Castle Clash

  
WWE Supercard

  
Donald’s Empire

  
Solitaire Cube

  
Jewelish

  
Winter Adventures

  
Foot Chinko

  
Animalines

  
Traffic

  
Multisquare

  
Basket & Ball

  
Fruita Crush

  
Jetpack Master

  
Smarty Bubbles




There are basically dozens of games from every genre you can think of, which is a plus for AppNana.


Of course, the games that show up may vary in the amount of points you earn.


Just note that some games might be excluded from your list depending on where you live.


Pros & Cons



  
Excellent variety of games

  
Plenty of free gift card rewards

  
Very easy to use





  
You can redeem your points for PayPal cash

  
Very low earning potential

  
It takes a long time to cash out since you need 30,000 points to redeem a $1 gift card




Other AppNana Reviews


As mentioned, AppNana has over 100,000 reviews on the app store and some pretty positive reviews overall. However, I’m always a little wary of those sorts of metrics since it’s hard to gauge how many reviews are real.


If you search for AppNana on Reddit, you’ll see the general sentiment is that AppNana is legit but takes very long to redeem a reward.


As you can see, these Reddit users complain that they could never cash out with AppNana and that it’s not worth your time:


Again, I think this highlights why AppNana is truly best if you already enjoy mobile gaming and like their games list.


This other AppNana app review from YouTuber Digital Marketing Reviews also provides a great overview of how the app works, the earning potential, and why it might not be worth your time:


If you’re more interested in making money, various side gig apps are definitely a better option.


The Best Apps Like AppNana


In my opinion, AppNana isn’t one of the best gaming reward apps since it has such low earning potential.


Thankfully, there are plenty of other GPT sites and apps you can use instead to earn rewards in your spare time.


Some other apps like AppNana you can try include:



  
Rewarded Play: This U.S. and Canadian app lets you play exciting new games to earn gift cards

  
Mistplay: A leading gaming reward app for Android.

  
Money Well: Another way to play games for PayPal cash and gift cards.

  
Swagbucks: This site pays you for answering surveys, shopping online, downloading apps, playing games, and watching ads.

  
Cash Giraffe: Another Android app with a low $0.20 cash out requirement.

  
MyPoints: Another popular GPT platform that also has a $10 sign-up bonus.

  
Kashkick: Another way to answer paid surveys and play games for cash.




Tom also made a video that shares some other fun ways to play games for money that you can explore.


These websites won’t make you rich, but they’re much more consistent than AppNana and have higher earning potential. And some of them also have more methods to earn as well.


Frequently Asked Questions


What are AppNana Codes?


AppNana codes are invitation codes that allow you to earn 2,500 Nanas everytime a friend joins the app with your specific code.


Your friend will also receive an extra 2,500 Nanas for joining.


This is a pretty basic referral system, and considering rewards start around 30,000 Nanas, it’s not really a massive earner.


Are There AppNana Hacks?


There are AppNana hacks out there that promise an unlimited amount of Nanas. These hacks are scams! Stay away from any AppNana hacks at all costs. The golden rule of making money online or with apps is that if something seems too good to be true, it is!


Is AppNana IOS Available?


AppNana has an iOS gaming app you can use instead of the Android version. You’ll need to head over to appnana.com and download the app through there.


You can also head over to the App Store and download the app called “AppJoy Nana” (this is the IOS version of the app).


Final Thoughts


If you’re not a huge gamer and just want to earn some extra cash, you’re better off using some sort of gig economy app to make your time worthwhile.


After testing out AppNana, I found that the app was easy to use. But it barely pays anything, so it’s not a very lucrative side hustle.


If you’re a big fan of mobile video games and would likely play these games anyways, then you could give AppNana a try!


Ultimately, apps like Mistplay and Rewarded Play are probably the apps you should try first. Once your earnings decline, you can try apps like AppNana and App Flame to keep your rewards coming.
