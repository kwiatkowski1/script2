Darkstar hunter


Darkstar hunter is a pet that was created in the update "muscle king" with galaxy oracle crystal on July 5, 2021, it is currently one of the rarest and best pet after cybernetic showdown dragon without Robux, it is inspired by a pack of ninja legends.


Now is the 7th best pet (correct me if something is wrong)


Appearance


Darkstar hunter looks like a dragon and rabbit, it has 3 heads and its fur is white, it has a black aura.


Stats: lvl 1: 80 strength, 55 agility, 60 durability


Max Stats: 270 strength, 195 agility, 445 durability


Stats evolved: lvl 1 : 875 strength, 500 agility, 1.75 K durability.


Max Stats evo: 970 strength, 595 agility, 1,84 K durability


Note: You need 30 rebirths to use Darkstar Hunter, its very sad but it's the reality, to get it, you have to translate to muscle king portal, after that you need 1.5 M gems or more, it's rare that it comes out so good luck.


Fun fact: is more powerful than muscle king aura


(i wrote badly because is on translate and everything you read is from the translator, do not judge me)
