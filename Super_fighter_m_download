All jokes aside, this "game" seems to be broken or unusable as of 2022. The app gets stuck on the loading screen.


Habe versucht es herunterzuladen und jetzt will es auf Anrufe zugreifen. Bei Handy-Simulationen oder ähnlichem stürzt es einfach ab aber auf einen Virus auf meinem Handy habe ich auch kein Bock.


I refused to give the app access to make phone calls, and then the app just kept crashing and freezing.

This game is about skill and many other things, I don't even know how they created so many original characters, such as: Mario, Luigi, Donkey Kong.

I had cancer, I was a cripple, and I was just plain unhealthy before I played this game, however, once I first started this game I instantly came over all my illnesses and I became ultra-strong and healthy. Like if you agree!


Video Game / Super Fighter M - All Star


Super Fighter M - All-Star (Super 3D Mario 文明大冒险), translated by Cayman Game Inc. (and notably their only known release on Google Play Store until it was taken down; original Chinese developer unknown) was an Action RPG released for Android. Similar to the infamous Pocket All-Star Smash Brothers and the more obscure Super Mario 3D, this Unlicensed Game was a Massive Multiplayer Crossover Role-Playing Game using the most recent Super Mario Bros. game at the time as the base theme (in this case, Super Mario Odyssey). This game was released back in 2019, but began to garner attention when the English version was released in November 2020.


The game's Excuse Plot involves Mario asking to marry Peach only to be interrupted by Wedding Bowser, who (surprise, surprise) kidnaps her. Like in Super Mario Odyssey, Mario is eventually knocked out by Bowser, sending him crashing down where he meets Cappy who serves as his companion.


The gameplay involves bringing a team of five (though the player started with only two, counting the main character, until they reach higher levels) to fight enemies using basic attacks or special skills limited by Cooldown. In a normal campaign, a stage is cleared when all enemies are defeated.


As typical for MMO like this, the game has the Social features where the player can see their current ranking against others, Friends list, and the Mailbox to receive messages and gifts. The game also has the Guild system, the usual Shop, Quests, and the Field menu where additional daily events can be played to gather more items. Additional heroes can be obtained via the TS Summon, the game's gacha system.


The game was eventually terminated on March 8, 2021 due to repeated failed appeals to Google and issues with the use of third-party payment to bypass the disabled in-app purchases when it was taken off from Google Play Store.

This game provides examples of:



  
100% Completion: Earning all three stars in a world in the main campaign allows the player to earn all the rewards offered by said world.

  
Achievement System: The Side Quests reward the player for reaching certain milestones in the game. The Endless Adventure has its own milestone achievements based on player progress, battles, and events triggered.

  
Addressing the Player: During the main campaign, whatever username the player inputted in becomes Mario's name when another character refers to him.

  
After-Combat Recovery: By default, all heroes are healed fully after a stage clear, except for Endless Adventure, which only heals slightly, as the mode tests the player's party's endurance. Sprixie Kingdom does not allow the team to restore their health between battles either even after a Kingdom is cleared.

  
Anti-Frustration Features: 

  
Certain battles can be Blitzed (only possible after clearing them with the full 3 stars) to skip all that and go straight to the loot screen.

  
Similarly, a Sprixie Kingdom can be skipped altogether, with the catch that the player's team power has to be triple the recommended amount regardless of the flawless victories done on the same Kingdom over and over.

  
Starting a new Endless Adventure session will place the player on the highest possible floor with the recommended power roughly half their current power count instead of starting from the very beginning. Note that floor boss battles are unskippable themselves, so this saves time.

  
Once the player hits level 45, the Transfer option for heroes becomes available. This allows the player to transfer all invested EXP, Boost levels, Awaken levels, and Badge upgrades of a hero to another one. If the player finds an invested hero unused, the Transfer menu saves time from having to grind resources again to have a better hero reach the same bonus invested stats (sans Ascension bonus, since it is unique to the hero and tied to his/her Talent note Passive effects unique to a character, for example a chance to inflict status effect every attack. ) as the former.



  
In Multiplayer, none of the (AI-controlled) other team's heroes use their Limit Breaks. Only their lead characters do.



  
A player's Friends list is limited to 40.

  
Item capacity per category is limited by 60 by default, only increased the higher the player's VIP level is.



  
Player level also determines main character level, meaning their maintenance is limited to enhancing via Wardrobe Upgrade, Star Up, Awakening, Kirby Star equipment, and Outfits. Experience to raise this level can be earned from completing quests or clearing battles.

  
Hero level can only be boosted by giving said hero EXP Mushrooms.



  
For characters, quality goes from blue>purple>yellow>red>rainbow.

  
For items, quality goes from white>green>blue>purple>orange>red.

  
Damage numbers from the player's attacks are colored white, while damage taken from enemies is red.

  
During Endless Adventure, a random event that shows up as a mini-game is indicated by the coin color that pops out. Green for Flip a Card (pick one of face-down cards to receive whatever is shown), purple for rock-paper-scissors (three said hand signs change from one to the other in rapid succession, and the player has to stop with the winning sign against the Enemy side to win a reward), and red for Turn the Sun, Moon, and Star (pick one of the three symbols and hope it matches the dice block after it spins).



  
Combat Medic: Restore-type heroes (though called Support on the Help menu). They focus on buffs and debuffs, or HP recovery.

  
Glass Cannon: Attack-type heroes. They focus on big damage, but tend to lack enough HP to survive long.

  
Damage Over Time: Control-type heroes. They have a set of skills that utilize Status Effects to ensure team survival and victory.

  
Stone Wall: Tank-type heroes. They have beefy HP to survive strong attacks or long battles.



  
Guild Mascots have beefy HP. Justified, as they are meant to be defeated by multiple guild members.

  
Bosses are this by default, having multiple health bars.



  
As explained in Cut and Paste Environments, a given World does not always use the matching environments for its stages, like a desert in a forest-themed World.

  
Sprixies are Fairy Companions used to boost the player team's overall stats by simply existing (not necessarily equipped). The Sprixie Princess is the only actual Sprixie in this group.



  
One early stage involves the player defending the Washing Machine. Nothing protects it except the player's party, so the player has to avoid going too far away beating up enemies.

  
Sprixie Land battles involve the player guarding the defenseless Sprixie Princess from waves of enemies until the boss is defeated. This mode is the main source of Prayer Stones used to upgrade the player's Sprixies.



  
The loot system from battles features items that will be gotten upon clearing, but whether the player will get them and how many they are if the player does get them are random.

  
Chest items that do not allow the player to pick the prize are subject to this.



  
The TS Summon periodically has the God-level Hero Summon event where the player can obtain certain SSR heroes otherwise not available in other gacha options. These "super rare" SSR heroes share the same summoning probability as the other SSR heroes, so even performing a Summons x10 (already requiring event-only Battery SSS) will not guarantee one since it uses the same "guaranteed SR or above" rule as the Limited Hero Summon and Hero III Summon options. And good luck going for "SSR guaranteed" 50 summons if the player is not a whale, and even then, it is still not a guarantee and the player will end up getting the more "common" SSR hero instead.

  
As mentioned above, the "guaranteed SR or above" bonus from Summons x10 means that red-tier gear and SSR heroes become this in general.



  
Poison inflicts Damage Over Time on the affected. May stack on top of each other up to 20 times to increase the amount of health sapped.

  
DEF Decline is a Damage-Increasing Debuff on the affected.

  
Burn and Bleed also inflict Damage Over Time minus the stack capability. Certain skills inflict additional damage on burning/bleeding targets.

  
Freeze, Fear, Petrified, and Stun prevent the affected from moving and taking any action.

  
Bind locks the affected in place, even preventing skills that move the affected from working properly.

  
Prevent Recovery is Exactly What It Says on the Tin, preventing the affected from using HP recovery skills.

  
Slow, obviously, slows down the affected's movement speed.



  
However, the game itself became this, as it was terminated by its developer on March 8, 2021 (though the official news came out the next day).



  
Badge upgrades require Medals and/or Ribbons of certain quality (along with the usual Coins).

  
Awakening a character to raise their stats or power up their skills requires Book items matching the character's role type (Almighty Books can be used on any role, but this is a necessity for Justice and Dark characters). For lead characters, they all use the Hero Books regardless of role type.

  
Twin Cherries and Boost Stars are used on a hero's Boost menu, also to raise stats.
