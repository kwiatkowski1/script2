What are NBA 2K Mobile codes used for?


As you can see in the list above, most codes are used for redeeming high-rated player cards. This allows you to build an extremely strong squad of players for your MyTeam mode even without having to purchase in-game currency.


Building your own roster of superstars is the game’s primary objective, so obtaining top-rated players is a massive boost that no one should miss out on.


Although there are no active codes available at this moment, NBA 2K Mobile receives regular events and updates when new codes are revealed. Given that the current code is set to expire on April 9, 2023, the next code to unlock a top-tier player is likely right around the corner.


Even without codes, you can always complete the time-limited sets to unlock and claim even more exclusive rewards to boost your in-game performance.


So, there you have it – that’s everything you need to know about NBA 2K Mobile codes for April 2023.
