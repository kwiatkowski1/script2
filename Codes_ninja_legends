Roblox Ninja Legends codes (January 2023): Free Chi, Souls, and more


Roblox Ninja Legends amassed over one billion visits due to its interactive, action-packed gameplay and other immersive features. As the title hints, players are tasked with becoming elite ninjas on the mysterious map.


Additionally, players must explore the map, unlock new areas, and engage in duels to earn in-game money. They can also purchase a variety of pets and shurikens to boost their attributes and damage.


Newbies will struggle with the gameplay as they will lack resources and weapons. That is when they must consider redeeming the promo codes featured in this article.
