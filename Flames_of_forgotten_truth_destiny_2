Here are all of Destiny 2’s working emblem codes (March 2023)


Destiny 2 is a first-person looter shooter, but it’s all about fashion. Your armor is important, as is your weaponry, but there’s a lot more to it than that.


Emblems, along with your ship, shader, sparrow, and Ghost, are key parts of showing off your Guardian’s personality. Emblems can be found in the game by completing activities or triumphs, but some are also given out periodically by Bungie as part of promotions.


To get some of these emblems, you can log in to your account on Bungie.net and then head to the Redeem Codes page. Here, you can enter a short nine-character code to unlock some emblems. And the best part is that some of these codes are evergreen and can be entered whenever you want.


Here are all of the emblem codes that currently work for Destiny 2.

All emblem codes for Destiny 2 and how to get them (March 2022)


Emblems in Destiny 2 have been known to shape the Guardian's inventory in its own way. If a weapon or gear can forge a player for high-tier activities, shaders and emblems, make sure one looks the part. They can come in all colors and shapes, as getting your hands on exotic or rare items can spark interest in others.


In the last few months, the community has seemed to get hold of a few of these emblems that are mostly free to claim even now. Some of them have been available since last year, while a few of them were issued in March 2022. The following article lists the redeem codes for all free emblems available now.

On March 11, Bungie handed out a free emblem called "Cоняшник," to symbolize hope and express peace. Aside from releasing different free emblems throughout the month, Destiny 2 Community Manager decided to play a little game with players in February, where she hid the secret code of the Tangled Shore emblem.


The code for the legendary emblem was hidden in a TWAB (This Week at Bungie) alongside bold letters and hyperlinks.

All Destiny 2 Emblem codes and Shader codes for October 2021


A new month means new Destiny 2 Emblem codes, and August is no exception.


This month sees a considerable number of new Emblems up for grabs, and as always, they cost you nothing other than a few minutes of your time.


Bungie also releases a few Shader codes handy for spiffing up your armor each month. We'll keep our list up to date as new codes release, so make sure to check back regularly.


What are Destiny 2 Emblems?


Emblems are cosmetic items you can add to your guardian’s armor. They don’t affect gameplay or stats in any way. Normally, Emblems cost Glimmer or have requirements to unlock, but each month’s round of goods gives you a generous number of Emblems to pick from without having to do anything.


What are Destiny 2 Shaders?


Bungie also releases a few shader codes each month. You’ll use shaders to dye your armor, and, like Emblems, shaders usually require something from you.


How to redeem Destiny 2 Emblem codes and Shader codes


Navigate to the Destiny 2 code redemption page, and choose your platform. Sign in to your platform account, then just add your code and redeem it.


Emblems appear automatically in your Collections, under the Emblems section. However, you’ll need to collect Shaders from the Tower’s Shader Kiosk.

These are the Destiny 2 Emblem codes for October.

You can also earn the Share the Glass emblem by carrying 10 Guardians to the Vault of Glass the first time. Acquiring it is currently bugged, but Bungie plans on fixing that in the September 7 reset.


Destiny 2 Shader codes for October 2021


There aren’t quite as many Shader codes, as always, but July has two new colors to pick up at the Tower.
