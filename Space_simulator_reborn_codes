Some of them are exploring the world, characters, traveling to other planets, collecting and hatching pets.

With them, you will get gold that you can spend on weapons and storage anywhere you want, and there is a chance to get some exclusive premium items.


Every Space Simulator Codes that developers create will have an expiration date. This means that after some time they will expire. After they expire you will no longer be able to redeem them and you will lose your chance of getting some great free stuff.

What are Space Simulator Codes?


Space Simulator Codes is a way for developers to reward players for support and loyalty. They are great for new players so they can progress faster and have a great start to the game. What is great about codes is that they are free and safe to use and every player can redeem them.


How to redeem Space Simulator Codes?


There are a few steps that you have to do in order to redeem Space Simulator codes. It is an easy thing to do, just follow the steps down below:



  
Start Space Simulator game

  
Tap on the Settings Button located on the left side of your screen

  
Enter codes that you want to use

  
Tap on the confirmation button




That is all you have to do in order to redeem Space Simulator codes for free items. You will get your free items immediately if you follow all the steps and use a valid code. Now you can repeat the process with other codes.


Where to find Space Simulator codes?


There are a lot of sources that are posting Space Simulator Codes but not all of them are posting real ones. So the best place to look for new codes are official game social media accounts on Trello, Discord, Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook. Every time developers create a new one they will post it on a social media account so all players can have access to them.


One small problem with social media is that every time developers create a new post it will push posts with code further down increasing the chance that you will miss them and never find older ones and searching for them is extremely time-consuming and hard.


That is why we collected all codes ever created and put them in this list that we are updating every time code gets released. With this list, you will save so much time and get a lot of free items. Just be careful when you are looking for codes from other sources. If they ask you for login information to give you access to the codes they probably want to steal your account. So be careful.


When will the new Space Simulator Codes be available?


Developers do not have a fixed schedule for when they will release new codes so they can release them at any moment. But most of the time you can predict when that will be. Most developers are releasing codes when the game archives a goal with likes, visits, follow, etc. You should check for new ones every few days simply because developers can release them randomly just to reward players for support and loyalty
