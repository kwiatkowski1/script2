Learning the very hard way about social media hacking after my #Facebook account was #hacked and I no longer have access to it. I'm in limbo as I try to resolve the issues, but it's clear that there are few things I can do, and it's clear Facebook does not care. Be careful out there. #hacking #learning #socialmedia

Elon Musk Suffers a Huge Loss: Five months after buying Twitter for $44 billion, the billionaire estimates that the platform is worth just $20 billion! Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter has been very eventful. His reign at the head of the microblogging website is just as eventful. The serial entrepreneur finalized the deal on Oct. 27, after a long battle with the management of Twitter 1.0, marked by multiple twists, threats, and public insults. To top it off, the $44 billion purchase price paid by Musk was considered too high by analysts, who noted that the platform was not profitable and lagged behind its main rivals in terms of advertising revenue. Musk had tried to renegotiate the price but his efforts ended in bitter failure. A little over five months after becoming the "Chief Twit" as he described himself, the billionaire has just slashed the valuation of the platform by more than half. Twitter is now worth just $20 billion, Musk says, according to Platformer and The Information. This valuation is based on new equity grants to employees. If that $20 billion valuation is less than half of what Musk had paid, it could in theory be a bargain for employees in case the company's valuation rebounds. Usually startups offer stock options at very low valuations to attract talent. Twitter Could Be Worth $250 Billion In an email sent to employees, the tech mogul is very optimistic about the future of the platform, for which he predicts a surge in valuation in the coming years. "I see a clear, but difficult, path to a >$250B valuation," Musk wrote. This means that new shares would be worth much more -- 10 times to be precise -- than their current value. #elonmusktwitter #mergersandacquisitions https://lnkd.in/dtQWUMNE

Took a while to read through selected chapters in the book, but highly recommended read. Thank you Manu Joseph for sharing this with me. Definitely something I will keep referring to over and over again. Very well explained algorithms and examples 🙌 Two things that Iearnt new from the chapters I read so far were: 📌Interpretable TS forecasting models- N-BEATS and NHiTs 📌 Multistep forecasting strategies Have tried to explain my insights from the book in the video 👇 #timeseries #python #datascience #machinelearning

Good morning, today i find myself reporting the "lily collins" hack on Facebook Meta . This bot/virus hacks your account, changes your profile name to "lily collins", steals your payment information, tries to steal your money, and posts something that locks your account. So facebook automatically requests identity verification but almost immediately disables the account forever. There is a group that encloses nearly 1000 members with the exact same problem and difficulty talking to someone who can help with account recovery. If you are reading this post, please give us a tip below or by message. Thanks for the attention. Meta for Business Facebook Public Affairs FACEBOOK ITALY S.R.L.

Meta Platforms Inc. has shown gross negligence in securing our social media accounts and protecting our data. Their AI/bot moderation has also unfairly disabled many of our accounts. We must now go to small claims court to sue for various damages after losing our accounts, getting defamed, and/or harassed by trolls, hackers, and other bad actors who roam IG and FB with impunity. For US residents only. You can sue in San Mateo Co small claims (where Meta’s hq is) and ask a judge to appear by Zoom if you live elsewhere. https://www.peopleclerk.com/how-people-clerk-works

I am saddened to share with you that my personal Instagram and Facebook accounts have been hacked, and therefore suspended. Whilst we are working hard to get them back up and running, I’m conscious that this may not be a quick fix, therefore leaving you, my valuable community, without a platform to turn to for advice and information. In the meantime, I'll be co-running the balance social media accounts so all women can continue to have access to the content I share. Keeping you, my loyal followers informed is my priority so you can make decisions about your future health. I look forward to continuing this wonderful journey with you.

I have recently been hacked on my FB page by the Lily Collins hacker, and soon after my personal page was disabled by FB for contravening FB guidelines (hacker). I have two business pages attached to my personal page which I cannot access. I have tried and tried using FB Help to report, advise, seek assistance, and even submit a form with my identity proof which will not submit - just give an error message. I have tried emailing so many FB help emails, and I have tried reaching out in desperation to those in industry - Meta / FB through Linked In. More than 15 years of photographs, memories, connections, family, have been lost, and the loss of access/admin to my two business accounts. I am entirely in the hands of a multi billion $ company due to a hacker that has gained NOTHING from hacking me. Please please Craig D'Souza, M.B.A., CISM Angie Gifford Fares Akkad Lisa Stoner Rish Tandon Nick Lovrien, CPP Dan Neary Andy O'Connell Susan Cooper Michel Protti can you reach out to help? I know that you can because you already have to a few others. Please put me in touch with you Meta Support and open a case file for me. I need my business back.

Hi all Last night, some hackers hacked into my Facebook account. I tried to send an email to noreply@facebookmail.com and security@facebookmail.com, but my issue is: if it's that easy for anybody to hack any Facebook account, is Facebook really secure? Is there a guarantee that Facebook will keep our data private? How can we know that Facebook and Instagram are trustworthy? Even if my account isn't very large, I still have a lot of friends and followers. If someone else has a large number of followers, though, I'm curious how things will turn out for them. Facebook needs some kind of protection. What you think about that? Meta Facebook facebooksupport Instagram

The “Lily Collins” hacker is no joke. On March 28, my Facebook accout that I’ve had since ‘07 was hacked. In the past 48 hours I’ve changed passwords, reset 2FAs, deleted whole ass email accounts, read tons of Reddit and new articles of people who are suffering like me. This a data breach that facebook need to do better to get fixed! The hacker was completely able to bypass my previously set up 2FA. It happened over night and I didn’t get an email till almost 6 hours after the hacker was in, stating the email on my account had been changed and it was to late. The hackers are changing account names, emails and phone numbers so you cant get back in. They are posting ads/campaigns and stealing card information. Then posting content Facebook doesn’t allow to get the account disabled completely. This all happens in a short time period. I’m working still to get my old account back. I haven’t lost hope just yet. I created new page to hopefully get more answers. As well as regain access to the business pages I manage as this is a huge part of my job(s). I found a group of over 1.2k people who have been victims to this hack. A huge thing in common is we are/were hooked to Business Account management pages and/or Business pages of some form. If you or you know someone who is hooked to business profiles in any form I highly suggest changing all your stuff. I also suggest making sure you have multiple people on these business accounts. I know people who have now lost complete access to their business accounts because they were the only ones on them. Have a back up or two. The businesses I managed aren’t completely lost because we have multiple people on them and this is huge. It’s sad people are losing accounts they built for years. There’s no way to get a hold of anyone to discuss issues like this. That’s one of the most frustrating parts. If anyone have any ideas or suggestions feel free to shoot them my way. #facebook #lilycollinshacker

How will Twitter's recent announcement that they will 'no longer allow accounts to enroll in the text message/SMS method of Two Factor Authentication (2FA) unless they are Twitter Blue subscribers' affect you? For Tomasz Lesniara, if he had 2FA set up a few years ago, he wouldn't have been hacked, blackmailed for £1,000 and then had his nudes leaked to all his family and friends. 'One small change could have prevented that whole devastating situation. If I’d had two-factor authentication on my email, it wouldn’t have been possible to log into my inbox without typing in the numeric code sent to my phone via text message. 'Nearly a decade on, I am still traumatised. I regularly check the signed-in devices in my social media settings. I do not trust people I meet online easily. For years, I’ve felt like someone is reading my WhatsApp and Messenger texts. I hold back from sending anything personal on these channels. It’s hard to get over it.' In this strong opinion piece for Metro.co.uk, Tomasz describes how the emotional toll of being hacked still lingers with him today: #ElonMusk #Twitter #TwoFactorAuthentication #2FA #CyberSecurity https://lnkd.in/g7PmvQMs
