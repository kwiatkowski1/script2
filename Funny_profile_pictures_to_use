Aesthetic is in, just take a look at TikTok and the insane popularity of the app. It’s filled with e boys and e girls focusing on their aesthetic look and growing in followers.

1. One lone man, standing in the great beyond. Wait, is that Jupiter in the background?


2. Don’t tell me you like cotton candy more than I do, because it’s a lie.


3. Rainbows are just about as aesthetic as you get. Rainbows and space, just damn.


4. What a scene, dawn with a lone tree. Makes me want to sit by that tree and meditate.


5. This is the visual version of ASMR if I’ve ever seen one. Never heard of ASMR, do a quick YouTube search and give yourself a few hours to loose.


6. Never been to Japan, does that make me a bad person? I’ve eaten sushi at Whole Foods, does that count?


7. Snowy rooftops at dawn, the perfect way to start a day in the city. I wonder what city this is, Moscow maybe?

Profile Picture Ideas & Tips


Hold a picture of yourself long and steadily enough in your mind’s eye, and you will be drawn toward it. – Napoleon Hill


Now, you’ve looked through the lists of profile pictures and you probably have an idea in mind on what you want to use or at least the genre that you want to use in your pic.


If you’re still scratching your head, here are some tips to help you narrow down your profile.



  
Take into account where you’re at in life. Are you in school? If so you may want to use a picture of you in school. Are you in summer camp or a mom? Find a fitting picture for each scenario.

  
Do you want your profile picture to be of you, a real picture but of someone else or another animal or a drawing or cartoon? All of these are valid but it’s worthwhile to narrow down what you prefer.

  
Do you want to make people laugh when they see your picture? If so, choose a funny one. Want people to know you enjoy the beautiful things in life, choose an aesthetic pic.




It’s important to consider what the requirements and dimensions are for any given profile picture before landing on one. Some social media platforms have different pixel requirements or size requirements. Also, you don’t want your pic to be cropped because it didn’t fit into the pre-defined profile pic box.


How To Change Your Profile Picture On Different Platforms


Ok, so now you’ve decided on your new profile picture and you want to make sure you change it on all of the different accounts that you have. Here is a list with links to how to change your profile pic on lots of the big platforms.


How to change your profile picture on:


Unlike a typical username that can only be changed on occasion or you need to pay money to change (Roblox for example), you can change your profile picture as many times as you want on most platforms.


Given that, you should be able to add a new picture to suit your current life. In Greece playing on the ocean during summer break, snap an image and use that for a few months. Then you’re back in Chapel Hill and snap a photo in front of the Old Well and use that for a while. Now, it’s spring and take a pic with Roy Williams to flaunt around the internet for a bit.


Profile pictures are the best and truest way to represent you and your individuality online. Make sure this one counts.
