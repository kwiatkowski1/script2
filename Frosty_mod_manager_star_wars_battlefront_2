Cant launch battlefront 2 through frosty.


I am using the most recent version of the frosty mod manager and frosty fix. I have battlefront 2 through epic games and us the EA app (not origin). I tried using -datapath and then the mod data folder but it says it has invalid characters. I have changed the from the alpha to the full release. I tested with one mod then added a few more and now it won't launch. What do i do?

Frosty mod manager star wars battlefront 2


every time i launch battlefront 2 with frosty mod manager the game boots up but it only loads a black screen. It never gets to the menus as far as i know. I don't know how to fix this. It used to work before updating it to 1.06. It has only worked a few times with 1.06 but loads a black screen the majority of the time


There are 3 possibilities:


1. A mod no longer functions 
Solution: Deselect each new mod 1 by 1 until you find out which one is causing problems


2. 2 Mods are conflicting 
Solution(s): Go into the Frosty Mod Manager and do the same step as the first one, except you will want to at least want to try and check the info page on Nexus before deleting or re-installing


3. Mod Manager is Broken 
Solution: Completely Un-Install and Re-Install the Mod Manager
