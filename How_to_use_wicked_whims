MENSTRUAL CYCLE


The Menstrual Cycle is the regular natural change that occurs in the female reproductive system that makes pregnancy possible. Generally, Sims don't experience such complex systems and some gymnastics under the covers are enough to make a baby, but not anymore. Sims will now deal with the joys of the Premenstrual Syndrome, bleeding from periods, fighting against them with pads and tampons or preventing them with medication, planning ahead of the fertility window, to try to protect themselves with condoms and birth control pills, or "deal with" pregnancy after the fact. What a complex system indeed.


Menstrual Cycle content has been introduced in release v122 (December 2017) but grew and improved since them, so it's worth taking a look at it again.


Thank you to REMI for creating pads and tampons objects.


Thank you to Noir and Dark Sims for creating condoms and birth control pills objects.


Thank you to PhaseLotA for creating the menstrual cycle icons.



❌ Don't like Sims having a Menstrual Cycle? Simply open Wicked Settings -> Pregnancy Settings and uncheck the 'Menstrual Cycle Switch' setting. You can adjust the pregnancy chances with the 'Player Sims Pregnancy Chance' and 'NPC Sims Pregnancy Chance' settings.



Menstrual Cycle


Every Sim in the game that is capable of giving birth has its own unique Menstrual Cycle. Every cycle consists of 4 distinct segments: the Premenstrual Syndrome, the Period, the Fertile Windows (Ovulation), and the Luteal Phase. Sim's first day of the cycle is defined by the first day they begin bleeding. During that Period they will experience a set of hormonal moodlets and the need to use pads or tampons to avoid staining their underwear and clothes with menstrual blood. Afterward, come the fertile days. There are a few Fertile Windows that continuously increase the chance of conception until the day of Ovulation. And then comes nothing, as the Luteal Phase takes its time preparing another potential bloody disaster by thickening the lining of Sim uterus. Just a couple of days before the cycle begins anew, Sims might experience the Premenstrual Syndrome with a set of hormonal moodlets, warning them that another Period is coming. If the Sim got pregnant during the Fertile Windows, their cycle will continue with the next Period sometime after giving birth.


Duration of Sims Menstrual Cycle depends on the Sim Lifespan setting by default, but it can be overridden with the 'Menstrual Cycle Duration' setting in Wicked Settings -> Pregnancy Settings -> Menstrual Cycle Settings.


It's worth noting that Elder Sims do not have a menstrual cycle anymore, as they already went through menopause.


Menstrual Cycle - Period, PMS & Bleeding


Sims on their Period will experience hormonal side-effects and menstrual bleeding. Similarly, Sims during their PMS will just experience hormonal side-effects.


Hormonal Side-Effects are moodlets that involve things like being nauseous, irritated, dizzy, oversensitive, anxious, experiencing menstrual cramps, and even getting a little aroused. They don't last very long but can be countered by regularly taking Birth Control Pills or by taking the "Chill Pill" medication.
➡️ You can purchase both of these things via any computer under the 'Wicked' category or via the Build/Buy mode.



Don't like Sims having hormonal side-effects? Simply open Wicked Settings -> Pregnancy Settings ->; Menstrual Cycle Settings -> Advanced Settings and disable the 'Period Effect Moodlets' setting.



What about blood 🧛? Every Sim has variable menstrual blood flow strength, which is mostly randomized, with light flow being more common, and heavy flow being less common. That menstrual blood will stain your Sim underwear and clothes (not visually) unless pads or tampons are used. Using both at the same time is possible as well, and advised especially when Sim blood flow is heavy to avoid leaking. And you don't want to leak, other Sims might potentially smell it, the kind of Sims with fangs.


Don't worry though, by default Sims will use pads and tampons on their own, as long as some are in their inventory. They will seek the nearest toilet to apply it and dispose of the used one. You can adjust how often, if at all, Sims should use pads or tampons automatically. Simply click on a tampon or a pad in the Sim inventory and adjust their individual behavior with the 'Auto Use' category.


Optionally you can adjust pads and tampons absorbency by changing the 'Menstrual Cycle Tampon/Pad Absorbency' setting (found under Wicked Settings -> Pregnancy Settings -> Menstrual Cycle Settings) or purchase the Extra Absorbency trait from the Rewards Store for a 1000 Satisfaction Points.



Don't like Sims using toilets to apply pads and tampons? Simply open Wicked Settings -> Pregnancy Settings -> Menstrual Cycle Settings -> Advanced Settings and disable the 'Use Toilet to Change Pad/Tampon' setting.
Or maybe you don't like the bleeding idea at all? Simply open Wicked Settings -> Pregnancy Settings -> Menstrual Cycle Settings -> Advanced Settings and disable the 'Period Bleeding' setting.



➡️ You can purchase pads and tampons via any computer under the 'Wicked' category or via the Build/Buy mode, they come in purple boxes labeled Kaya. Additionally, you can ask other Sims if they have a spare pad or tampon.


Menstrual Cycle - Fertility & Birth Control


When in the heat of Vaginal (or Climax) sex, Sims are in a position that can cause pregnancy. You will be notified about a potential pregnancy occurring when that happens, even if Sims are using protection, as condoms and birth control pills are not perfect.



Don't like being notified about potential pregnancy occurring? Simply open Wicked Settings -> Pregnancy Settings and disable the 'Pregnancy Notifications' setting.



Sims fertility depends on the day of their cycle, as they can only become pregnant during the Fertile Windows. For a few days, right after the Period, the fertility rate grows until the Ovulation day ends. Sims can inspect their fertility level by performing the 'Fertility Awareness Test' using any toilet. Additionally, they can use their phone to make an appointment for a Fertility Treatment service, purchase the Fertile trait from the Rewards Store, and get a fertility massage or potion to increase their chances. Once you believe a Sim should be pregnant, use the Pregnancy Test by clicking on a toilet to verify if that's the case, and don't use external mods to verify it, that test is necessary.



Feeling unlucky? You can adjust overall fertility rates by simply opening Wicked Settings -> Pregnancy Settings -> Menstrual Cycle Settings -> Menstrual Cycle Fertility Level and selecting what you find appropriate.



What if I don't want a baby 😱? Condoms and Birth Control Pills will help with that quite a bit. Using condoms is simple enough, just wrap that bad boy during sex and you're good. Of course condoms can fail, but you can be double sure of their effectiveness if your partner is taking birth control pills. That is if they are taking them regularly because birth control pills only take effect after 3 days from the first time a Sim took one.



Don't like the idea of condoms failing or taking birth control pills for at least 3 days for them to work? Simply open Wicked Settings -> Pregnancy Settings -> Birth Control Settings -> Birth Control Accuracy and set it to Perfect Mode.



Have you guessed it already? Sims will use condoms and take birth control pills automatically! Condoms will be applied on their own from any Sim participating in sex during acts that can cause pregnancy. Birth control pills will be applied on their own during the day, right after the previous one loses its effect. Hands-free! When you don't have to hold a baby that is. And of course, you can adjust Sims using contraceptives automatically. Simply click on a condom or a birth control pill in the Sim inventory and adjust their individual behavior with the Allow/Disallow interaction.



Want to prevent all Sims from using contraceptives? Simply open Wicked Settings -> Pregnancy Settings -> Birth Control Settings and adjust Sims behavior using the 'Condom Automatic Use', 'Pills Automatic Use', and 'NPC Sims Birth Control Use Behavior' settings.



➡️ You can purchase condoms and birth control pills via any computer under the 'Wicked' category or via the Build/Buy mode.


It's worth noting, that the impregnating Sims, which are usually males, have an equal role in conceiving a child, and their fertility level matters as well.


Menstrual Cycle - Period Tracker App


All this information and complex mechanics can be difficult to keep track of. That's why you need an app that does it for you! Every Sim that already experienced their first period will get access to the Kaya Period Tracker app. You can find it on your Sim phone.


Using the Kaya Period Tracker app will inform you about your current Menstrual Cycle day, when is your next PMS, your next Period, and the upcoming fertility days. Knowing when your PMS and Period is going to being can help you prepare ahead by ordering Chill Pills or start taking Birth Control Pills. And knowing when are your most fertile days will help you plan ahead for some sexy time to get pregnant.

Future Plans


It's easy to notice that some things are still missing. Sims lack an easy ability to counter pregnancy after the fact, so some form of Plan B has to be introduced. When combating bleeding, Sims are missing out on the powerful Menstrual Cup. Taking birth control pills every day sucks, so perhaps an IUD could be added. And an easy access source of pads and tampons should exist, like a dispenser.

Support for Custom CAS Parts


This tutorial will explain to you the basics of adding support for different kinds of custom CAS parts that work with WickedWhims. Currently supported CAS Parts are: Male/Female Top, Male/Female Bottom, Male/Female Soft and Hard Penis, Male/Female Feet, Male/Female Pubic Hair, Cum, Strapon, Condom, Male Underwear, and Female Underwear. Each of these types is added in a different way so please read the appropriate tutorial below.


1. Download Resources


Pick one of the manager tools (S4PE or S4S):


TOOL > S4PE - Download


TOOL > Sims4Studio - Download


S4PE (Sims 4 Package Editor) is a simplistic tool to edit Sims 4 resources. It might not be the most intuitive to use for beginners, but it’s the easiest to use for this tutorial.


S4S (Sims 4 Studio) is a complex tool to edit and create Sims 4 resources. With plenty of tutorials it is a relatively easy tool to learn, but for this tutorial it is harder to use.


TOOL > Modding Toolbox - Download (or use Hash Generator in Sims4Studio) 


Modding Toolbox is used to generate hash values for the XML templates. If you’re going to use Sims4Studio, the alternative for it is under ‘Tools -> Hash Generator’.


Pick the template for the CAS parts you want to add:


TEMPLATE > Condom CAS Template - Download 
(Open -> Right Click -> Save as…)


TEMPLATE > Strapon CAS Template - Download 
(Open -> Right Click -> Save as…)


TEMPLATE > Underwear CAS Template - Download 
(Open -> Right Click -> Save as…) 


TEMPLATE > Body CAS/Tongue Object Template - Download 
(Open -> Right Click -> Save as…) 


TEMPLATE > Pubic Hair CAS Template - Download 
(Open -> Right Click -> Save as…)


TEMPLATE > Cum CAS Template - Download
(Open -> Right Click -> Save as…


TEMPLATE > Undressable CAS Template - Download
(Open -> Right Click -> Save as…


Condom CAS Parts Template is used to add support for custom condoms in WickedWhims. They are used during sex. You are required to make a condom wrapper object and a visible condom CAS part for the full support of condoms.


Strapon CAS Parts Template is used to add support for custom strapons in WickedWhims. They are used during sex. You are required to make a visible strapon CAS part that is selectable at the CAS screen.


Underwear CAS Parts Template is used to add support for custom underwear in WickedWhims. It’s used when randomizing underwear on Sims.


Body CAS Parts Template is used to add support for custom naked body parts in WickedWhims. They can be selected by the user using the Body Selector menu in-game. It’s recommended to make a square icon that will be displayed in the Body Selector menu.


Tongue Object Parts Template is used to add support for custom tongue body part in WickedWhims. They can be selected by the user using the Body Selector menu in-game. It’s recommended to make a square icon that will be displayed in the Body Selector menu.


Pubic Hair CAS Parts Template is used to add support for custom dynamic pubic hair in WickedWhims. It's used to apply appropriate hair color to the Sim body and identify stages of hair growth.


Cum CAS Parts Template is used to add support for custom cum layers in WickedWhims. They can be selected as a package in an in-game menu by the user.


Undressable CAS Parts Template is used to add support for clothing with multiple stages of undressing or revealing clothing in WickedWhims. Undressable clothing can be dynamically undressed. Revealing clothing contains nude body.


These applications are optional. If you don’t own any coloring text editor, try one out:


> Sublime Text - Download


The editor used in this tutorial is Sublime Text. It will help with readability of the variables that need to be edited. The same can be done with Notepad++.


> XML Validation - Open


XML Validation is helpful after you’re done with your XML file. Copy and paste your XML file to the XML Validation page and see if the file structure is correct and without error.


2. Create Hash Values


Every XML template requires a decimal and a hexadecimal ID that will be created using the Modding Toolbox (or S4S Hash Generator).


> 2.1. Type in the name of your file and make sure it contains your name.


Recommended naming: “YOUR_NAME:Something_CAS_Parts”, example: 'TURBODRIVER:Condom_CAS_Parts’.


> 2.2. Copy the FNV 64 field without the '0x’ prefix. 


> 2.3. Replace the '0000000000000000’ at the end of the XML Template file name with copied FNV 64 value.


The XML file should be originally named 'S4_7DF2169C_00000000_0000000000000000.xml’.


> 2.4. Switch the display result to 'Decimal’. 


> 2.5. Copy the FNV 64 field. 


> 2.6. Replace the '0000000000000000’ inside of the XML Template file with copied FNV 64 value.


The XML file should originally contain a variable looking like s="000000000000000000".


> 2.7. Replace the 'YOURNAME. ’ inside of the XML Template file with the file name that has your name and was used to generate the FNV 64 values.


3. Retrieve CAS Part ID


Fields ‘cas_part_id’ or ‘cas_part_ids’ will require entering a decimal Instance ID of your CAS part(s).


For S4PE, the Instance ID is located under “Instance” at the list of resources. CAS Parts can be recognized by the “CASP” tag. It’s a hexadecimal value.


For S4S, the Instance ID is located under “Instance” at the list of resources or at the “Key” section on the right panel when the CAS Part is selected. It’s a hexadecimal value.


To convert a hexadecimal value to decimal, use the ‘Convert’ tab inside Modding Toolbox or inside Sims4Studio.


4. Create Condom CAS Parts


Skip, if you’re not adding condoms. 


Condoms work by using a Condom Wrapper Object than then gets unpacked and applied on the Sim body in form of a CAS Part. This means that each condom CAS Part requires to have its own Condom Wrapper Object. And each individual Condom Wrapper Object has to have its unique XML Tuning file with a unique Instance ID that is used as the reference to the condom CAS Part.


All of the variables highlighted in red should be modified for the file to work correctly and support your CAS part.


> 4.1.1 Variable 'cas_part_raw_display_name’ is the name of your CAS Part that might be displayed to the user in-game. Make sure to name it appropriately.


> 4.1.2 Variable 'cas_part_author’ is your name that might be displayed to the user in-game. 


> 4.1.3 Variable 'cas_part_id’ is the decimal Instance ID of your CAS Part.


To get the decimal Instance ID of your CAS Part, copy the hexadecimal Instance ID (Key) of your CAS Part (example: 0x143A310339A3E4A6) and convert it to decimal by using the ‘Convert’ tab inside Modding Toolbox or inside Sims4Studio.


> 4.1.4 Variable 'cas_part_reference_id’ is the decimal Instance ID the tuning file used for the condom wrapper object.


This requires each condom wrapper object to have a separate tuning file with a unique Instance ID.


> 4.1.5 Variable 'required_cas_part_id’ is an optional field that makes sure a CAS Part is not applied unless a different one is already present on the Sim. 


This should be used with the hard penis CAS Part ID that fits the condom texture and model. Not every penis model will look correct with a condom applied.


> 4.2 Condom Wrapper Tuning


Your Condom Wrapper Object has to have a unique tuning file. To make that tuning file interactable with WickedWhims, you need to assign it “_super_affordances“. These are the interactions required for the condom to be functional:


12214374159487695556 15594836868367128156 10974543514180352698 15247761224639232100


It’s important that the tuning file contains the “inventory_item“ component with “inventory_only“ enabled so it can only be used from inside of the Sim inventory.


5. Create Strapon CAS Parts


Skip, if you’re not adding strapons. 


Strapons are automatically applied on Sims when they are required by the animation. This means that every Sim has a predefined strapon part that can be changed. For WickedWhims to detect the existence of strapons, the XML file has to contain its CAS Part ID.


All of the variables highlighted in red should be modified for the file to work correctly and support your CAS part.


> 5.1 Variable 'cas_part_raw_display_name’ is the name of your CAS Part that is be displayed to the user in-game. Make sure to name it appropriately.


> 5.2 Variable 'cas_part_author’ is your name that might be displayed to the user in-game


> 5.3 Variable ‘cas_part_display_icon’ is used to display an icon in the Strapon Selector menu.


Not changing the default icon will result in the default WickedWhims icon being shown instead.


> 5.3.1 When using S4PE, you can convert a PNG file into a DDS file using the Aorta DDS application (don’t include MipMaps when converting). 


S4PE resource type for the icons is _IMG 0x00B2D882.


> 5.3.2 When using S4S, you can simply import a PNG file as a DST Image. 


S4S resource type for the icons is DSTImageResource.


> 5.4 Variable 'cas_part_id’ is the decimal Instance ID of your CAS Part.


To get the decimal Instance ID of your CAS Part, copy the hexadecimal Instance ID (Key) of your CAS Part (example: 0x143A310339A3E4A6) and convert it to decimal by using the ‘Convert’ tab inside Modding Toolbox or inside Sims4Studio.


6. Create Underwear CAS Parts


Skip, if you’re not adding underwear. 


Underwear is used when Sims undress, these files are used to randomize underwear on all Sims in-game so they don’t have to use the default white underwear.


All of the variables highlighted in red should be modified for the file to work correctly and support your CAS part.


> 6.1 Variable 'cas_part_raw_display_name’ is the name of your CAS Part that might be displayed to the user in-game. Make sure to name it appropriately.


> 6.2 Variable 'cas_part_author’ is your name that might be displayed to the user in-game


> 6.3.1 Variable ‘cas_part_id’ is used when ‘cas_part_type’ is set to UNDERWEAR_MALE, and it is the decimal Instance ID of underwear CAS part.


Male underwear only requires one part, the bottom part.


To get the decimal Instance ID of your CAS Part, copy the hexadecimal Instance ID (Key) of your CAS Part (example: 0x143A310339A3E4A6) and convert it to decimal by using the ‘Convert’ tab inside Modding Toolbox or inside Sims4Studio.


> 6.3.2 Variable ‘cas_part_ids’ is used when ‘cas_part_type’ is set to UNDERWEAR_FEMALE, and it is the list of decimal Instance IDs of underwear CAS parts. 


Female underwear requires two parts, the top part and the bottom part. These are divided by the comma character.


To get the decimal Instance ID of a CAS Part, copy the hexadecimal Instance ID (Key) of your CAS Part (example: 0x143A310339A3E4A6) and convert it to decimal by using the ‘Convert’ tab inside Modding Toolbox or inside Sims4Studio.


7. Create Body CAS Parts


Skip, if you’re not adding body parts. 


Naked body parts are used when Sims undress, and for the user to use the naked body parts, it is required to add them to the Body Selector menu.


All of the variables highlighted in red should be modified for the file to work correctly and support your CAS part.


> 7.1 Variable 'cas_part_raw_display_name’ is used to display the name of your CAS Part in the Body Selector menu. Make sure to name it appropriately.


> 7.2 Variable 'cas_part_author’ is used to display your name in the Body Selector menu.


> 7.3 Variable ‘cas_part_display_icon’ is used to display an icon in the Body Selector menu.


Not changing the default icon will result in the default WickedWhims icon being shown instead.


> 7.3.1 When using S4PE, you can convert a PNG file into a DDS file using the Aorta DDS application (don’t include MipMaps when converting). 


S4PE resource type for the icons is _IMG 0x00B2D882.


> 7.3.2 When using S4S, you can simply import a PNG file as a DST Image. 


S4S resource type for the icons is DSTImageResource.


> 7.4 Variable ‘cas_part_type’ is the type of the body part that is being added. 



  
BODY_TOP_MALE is for masculine or feminine males top.

  
BODY_TOP_FEMALE is for female breasts.

  
BODY_BOTTOM_MALE is for males without a penis.

  
BODY_BOTTOM_FEMALE is for females bottom (vulva).

  
BODY_FEET_MALE is for males feet.

  
BODY_FEET_FEMALE is for females feet.

  
PENIS_SOFT_MALE is for males soft penis.

  
PENIS_SOFT_FEMALE is for females soft penis (female with a penis).

  
PENIS_HARD_MALE is for males hard penis.

  
PENIS_HARD_FEMALE is for females hard penis (female with a penis).

  
ROBOT_PENIS_HARD is for servo hard penis (only visible during sex).

  
WEREWOLF_PENIS_HARD is for werewolf hard penis (only visible during sex).




> 7.5 Variable 'cas_part_id’ is the decimal Instance ID of your CAS Part.


To get the decimal Instance ID of your CAS Part, copy the hexadecimal Instance ID (Key) of your CAS Part (example: 0x143A310339A3E4A6) and convert it to decimal by using the ‘Convert’ tab inside Modding Toolbox or inside Sims4Studio.


The CAS part is not required to match the intended body type. You are allowed to make your body parts a native tattoo and use the advantages of texturing a body part as if it was a tattoo. In that case, you are still required to include it with a mesh.


> 7.6 Variable 'penis_sliders' is a set of variables responsible for any penis length, girth, vertial tilt, testicles size, and testicles asymmetry sliders.


This set of variables should be completely removed from the file (or left with 0 [zero] values) if the penis does not use custom sliders for length and girth. You are not required to provide both length and girth sliders at the same time if the default sliders work correctly. Providing length and girth sliders is OPTIONAL, as the built-in penis sliders support all penis models.


> 7.6.1 Variables 'length_slider_low' and 'length_slider_high' are the decimal Instance ID of your penis length sliders.


> 7.6.2 Variables 'girth_slider_low' and 'girth_slider_high' are the decimal Instance ID of your penis girth sliders.


> 7.6.3 Variables 'testicles_slider_low' and 'testicles_slider_high' are the decimal Instance ID of your testicles sliders.


> 7.6.4 Variables 'testicles_asymmetry_slider_low' and 'testicles_asymmetry_slider_high' are the decimal Instance ID of your testicles asymmetry sliders.


> 7.6.5 Variables 'tilt_vertical_slider_low' and 'tilt_vertical_slider_high' are the decimal Instance ID of your penis vertical tilt sliders.


Resource type for a penis slider is Sim Modifier (0xC5F6763E).


Technically the sliders functionality is not limited to only hard penis body type variants, as a fully rigged soft penis mesh will still dynamically adjust to slider manipulation.


> 7.7 Variable 'special_case_cas_parts' is a set of variables responsible for special cases CAS Parts.


> 7.7.1 Variable 'non_animated_vagina_cas_part_id' is a decimal Instance ID of special case CAS Part used during sex animations that are configured to use the non-animated vagina CAS Part.


By default, the CAS Part set in the 'cas_part_id' variable should be the animated variant. It is advised a non-animated variant is made that doesn't use the testicle bones for animating the vaginal opening for best sex animations compatibility.


> 7.7.2 Variable 'detail_overlay_cas_part_id' is a decimal Instance ID of special case CAS Part used when revealing clothing is present on the Sim.


Clothing made by Content Creators can sometimes display naked body. If this clothing is recognized as supported revealing clothing, WickedWhims will automatically apply the CAS Part set in the 'detail_overlay_cas_part_id' variable. This allows the clothing to correctly display the naked body skin details.


8. Create Tongue Object Parts


Skip, if you’re not adding body parts. 


❗ The tongue is not a CAS Part, it's a game object that gets attached to the Sim.


The tongue object is used during Sims sex, and for the user to use the tongue object parts, it is required to add them to the Body Selector menu. The Tongue Object uses the same template as the Body CAS Parts.


All of the variables highlighted in red should be modified for the file to work correctly and support your object part.


> 8.1 Variable 'cas_part_raw_display_name’ is used to display the name of your Object Part in the Body Selector menu. Make sure to name it appropriately. 


> 8.2 Variable 'cas_part_author’ is used to display your name in the Body Selector menu. 


> 8.3 Variable ‘cas_part_display_icon’ is used to display an icon in the Body Selector menu.


Not changing the default icon will result in the default WickedWhims icon being shown instead.


> 8.3.1 When using S4PE, you can convert a PNG file into a DDS file using the Aorta DDS application (don’t include MipMaps when converting). 


S4PE resource type for the icons is _IMG 0x00B2D882.


> 8.3.2 When using S4S, you can simply import a PNG file as a DST Image. 


S4S resource type for the icons is DSTImageResource.


> 8.4 Variable ‘cas_part_type’ should be set to 'TONGUE'. 


> 8.5 Variable 'cas_part_id’ is the decimal Instance ID of your Object Definition. 


Although the name indicates a CAS Part, you are meant to set the Object Definition. To get the decimal Instance ID of your Object Definition, copy the hexadecimal Instance ID (Key) of your Object Definition (example: 0x143A310339A3E4A6) and convert it to decimal by using the ‘Convert’ tab inside Modding Toolbox or inside Sims4Studio.


> 8.6 Tongue Tuning 


Your Tongue Object has to have a unique tuning file. To make that tuning file interactable with WickedWhims, you need to assign it “_super_affordances“. These are the interactions required for the tongue to be hideable during sex.


12564566651884062727 11335874318828171674


9. Create Pubic Hair CAS Parts


Skip, if you’re not adding pubic hair parts. 


Pubic Hair parts are used on any Sim outfit, dressed or undressed, and they can be selected from a specialized Pubic Hair style menu.


All of the variables highlighted in red should be modified for the file to work correctly and support your CAS part.


> 9.1 Variable 'cas_part_raw_display_name’ is used to play the name of your CAS Part in a specialized Pubic Hair style menu. Make sure to name it appropriately.


> 9.2 Variable 'cas_part_author’ is used to display your name in a specialized Pubic Hair style menu.


> 9.3 Variable ‘cas_part_display_icon’ is used to display an icon in a specialized Pubic Hair style menu.


Not changing the default icon will result in the default WickedWhims icon being shown instead.


> 9.3.1 When using S4PE, you can convert a PNG file into a DDS file using the Aorta DDS application (don’t include MipMaps when converting). 


S4PE resource type for the icons is _IMG 0x00B2D882.


> 9.3.2 When using S4S, you can simply import a PNG file as a DST Image. 


S4S resource type for the icons is DSTImageResource.


> 9.4 Variable ‘cas_part_type’ is the type of the pubic hair part that is being added. 



  
PUBIC_HAIR_MALE is for male pubic hair.

  
PUBIC_HAIR_FEMALE is for female pubic hair.




 > 9.5 Variable ‘cas_part_subtype’ is the color type of the pubic part that is being added. 



  
GRAY

  
BLACK

  
LIGHT_BROWN

  
BROWN

  
BLONDE

  
DIRTY_BLONDE

  
AUBURN

  
ORANGE

  
CUSTOM




These are the base game natural hair colors. For any other color or a combination of colors, use the ‘CUSTOM’ type.


 > 9.6 Variable ‘cas_part_group’ is the name and identifier or your pubic hair parts group. 


Groups are Pubic Hair Parts that have the exact same style but different hair color. This variable is both used as a display name in-game and an identifier for the pubic hair implementation.


The Pubic Hair implementation comes with a randomization feature which allows users to select groups of pubic hair parts instead of individual parts.


Example: When creating a “Landing Strip” style that features all 8 nautral hair colors, give each and every “Landing Strip” part the same group name. When selecting pubic hair parts in-game, they will all show up as one entry with the group name (style name) instead of 8 individual entries for each color.


> 9.7 Variable 'cas_part_ids’ is the list of decimal Instance IDs of your CAS Parts. 


The Pubic Hair implementation comes with a dynamic hair growth feature. The list holds all growth stages represented by individual CAS parts. The first CAS Part ID on the list is the actual intended pubic hair CAS Part. Every subsequent CAS Part ID added to the list is recognized as a growth stage.


Example: The first CAS Part ID on the list is a landing strip pubic hair, the second one is short hair on the entire pubic hair area, and the third one is fully grown hair on the entire pubic hair area. With these three CAS Parts on the list, the growth will progress from a landing strip, to short hair, to long hair. You can add as many growth stages as you want to. Each growth stage can be reused in any other pubic hair part or as its own pubic hair parts.


To get the decimal Instance ID of your CAS Part, copy the hexadecimal Instance ID (Key) of your CAS Part (example: 0x143A310339A3E4A6) and convert it to decimal by using the ‘Convert’ tab inside Modding Toolbox or inside Sims4Studio.


> 9.8 Variable 'has_strict_visibility’ is a flag that sets the strict visibility rule for the pubic hair CAS Part. 


Setting this variable to ‘True’ will make pubic hair be only applied when Sim lower-half is fully naked.


Pubic Hair CAS Parts are applied on Sims at all times, not just when they undress. When adding 3D pubic hair that will clip through Sims clothing, set this flag to ‘True’ to only apply pubic hair when Sims are undressed.


10. Create Cum CAS Parts


Skip, if you’re not adding cum parts. 


Cum parts are used on any Sim outfit, dressed or undressed, and they can be selected from a selector menu.


All of the variables highlighted in red should be modified for the file to work correctly and support your CAS part.


> 10.1 Variable 'cas_part_raw_display_name’ is used to display the name of your Cum Package in the Cum Package Selector menu.


Make sure to name it appropriately and keep the name consistent across Cum CAS parts that are meant to be in one package. The name ties the Cum CAS Parts together as a Cum Package.


> 10.2 Variable 'cas_part_author’ is used to display your name in the Cum Package Selector menu. 


> 10.3 Variable ‘cas_part_display_icon’ is used to display an icon in the CAS Package Selector menu.


> 10.3.1 When using S4PE, you can convert a PNG file into a DDS file using the Aorta DDS application (don’t include MipMaps when converting). 


S4PE resource type for the icons is _IMG 0x00B2D882.


> 10.3.2 When using S4S, you can simply import a PNG file as a DST Image. 


S4S resource type for the icons is DSTImageResource.


 > 10.4 Variable ‘cas_part_subtype’ is the cum type/region of the cum part that is being added.  


You can only use one of each cum type/region per package. You are allowed to not include all cum types/regions.


> 10.5 Variable 'cas_part_ids’ is the list of decimal Instance IDs of your CAS Parts. 


The Cum implementation comes with a progressive quantity increase. The list holds all levels of quantity increase represented by individual CAS parts. You are allowed to only provide one CAS part.


To get the decimal Instance ID of your CAS Part, copy the hexadecimal Instance ID (Key) of your CAS Part (example: 0x143A310339A3E4A6) and convert it to decimal by using the ‘Convert’ tab inside Modding Toolbox or inside Sims4Studio.


> 10.6 Variable 'is_randomized’ is a flag that changes behavior of this Cum CAS Part from progressive quantity increase to randomized. 


Setting this variable to ‘True’ will make this Cum CAS Part randomized and select a random CAS Part from the 'cas_part_ids' variable.


11. Create Undressable CAS Parts


Skip, if you’re not adding undressable parts. 


Undressable parts can be used on any Sim outfit when dressed up. When an undressable part is on Sim outfit, it can be progressed from current part to next part, allowing the user to undress it in stages.


If just adding revealing clothing, no progressing mechanic apply, you are only required to set the 'cas_part_type' to the correct type.


All of the variables highlighted in red should be modified for the file to work correctly and support your CAS part.


> 11.1 Variable 'cas_part_raw_display_name’ is used for unique identifiaction of the part. Make sure to provide a unique name that is not used any other part.


> 11.2 Variable 'cas_part_author’ is used to for unique identification of the part.


> 11.3 Variable ‘cas_part_type’ is the type of the undressable part that is being added. 



  
UNDRESSABLE_TOP is for CAS parts that are the outfit top.

  
UNDRESSABLE_BOTTOM is for CAS parts that are the outfit bottom.

  
UNDRESSABLE_FULLBODY is for CAS parts that are the fullbody outfit.




If just adding revealing clothing, use these types.



  
REVEALING_TOP is for CAS parts that are the outfit top.

  
REVEALING_BOTTOM is for CAS parts that are the outfit bottom.

  
REVEALING_FULLBODY is for CAS parts that are the fullbody outfit.




> 11.4 Variable 'cas_part_ids’ is the list of decimal Instance IDs of your CAS Parts. 


The list holds progressing levels of undressing represented by individual CAS parts. You are required to provide at least two CAS parts.
If just adding revealing clothing, any number of CAS parts is allowed and no progressing levels mechanics applies. 


To get the decimal Instance ID of your CAS Part, copy the hexadecimal Instance ID (Key) of your CAS Part (example: 0x143A310339A3E4A6) and convert it to decimal by using the ‘Convert’ tab inside Modding Toolbox or inside Sims4Studio.


12. Package Tuning (XML)


For the XML tuning file to be used and detected, it has to be placed inside a PACKAGE file, preferably the one that contains the actual CAS parts. If you don’t have a package file, you should consider making the CAS parts first.


> 12.1 Using S4PE


Open S4PE, and then in the top bar, select “File”, and “ Open. ”. Open the PACKAGE file with your CAS Parts.


If you’re creating something that doesn’t involve your own CAS parts, click “New”, then “Save”, select where to save your new package, and follow further instructions.


While S4PE is running, open the folder with your XML file, click on it and hold, and then drag it over the S4PE window, and drop (aka drag and drop the file inside S4PE). Once you did that, save it (click “File” and “Save”).


> 12.2 Using S4S 


Open S4S, and then click “My Projects”. Open the PACKAGE file with your CAS Parts.


If you’re creating something that doesn’t involve your own CAS parts, click “Tools” at the top bar, and then “Create Empty Package”. Select where to save your new package, and follow further instructions.


To add the XML tuning file, click the “Add” button at the bottom-left, select “SnippetTuningResource” from the list as the Type, and paste the hexadecimal FNV 64 hash, that you have created at the beginning, without the ‘0x’ into the Instance field. Then press OK.


Select your file from the list on the left panel. On the right panel, make sure the “XML” tab is selected. Open your XML tuning file, select it all (CTRL+A), and then paste it into S4S right panel. Once you did that, save it with the “Save” button on the bottom-right.
