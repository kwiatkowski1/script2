PACYBITS FUT 20 for Android


PACYBITS FUT 20 is a card trading game where your collection affects the outcome of games you play. The app has a variety of modes that are suited to almost any playstyle.


Many modes and missions



PACYBITS FUT 20 is a collection and draft game where you can trade cards and compete against other players in tournaments.



PACYBITS FUT 20 is a card collecting and trading game where you can collect players and use them in your team or trade them for a more impactful character. The game has many modes that’ll keep you playing.


However, it’s important to note that without the limited-time events and objectives, it’s easy for this game to become a repetitive grind. Fortunately, for now, this won’t happen as your collection will grow, and tournaments provide a new challenge.


However, after an uncountable amount of the draft mode that you can play almost constantly, the game starts feeling stale. It won’t matter what the reward is, because you’ll play hoping for a lucky break. When you get to this point, you can swap over to multiplayer.


Multiplayer modes like tournaments provide you with a head-to-head challenge that single player draft fails to. These weekly tournaments change the rules by varying player conditions and can lead you to a no-restrictions tournament if you win all four.


You can continuously collect new cards and try to obtain your favorite characters by completing daily or weekly objectives. Both of these refresh at their respective rate and offer rewards that’ll help you progress through the divisions and upgrade your collection.


Where can you run this program?


PACYBITS FUT 20 is available for Android 5.0 and up as well as iOS 9.0 and later.


Is there a better alternative?


No. There is FIFA Football, but when compared to PACYBITS FUT 20, the community doesn’t shine as much as when you’re trading cards or doing the daily grind.


Our take
