热爱105°c的你 by 阿肆 (Super Idol) | Piano Letter Notes


Learn how to play 热爱105°c的你 by 阿肆 (Super Idol) with easy piano letter notes sheet music for beginners, suitable to play on Piano, Keyboard, Flute, Guitar, Cello, Violin, Clarinet, Trumpet, Saxophone, Viola and any other similar instruments you need easy letters notes chords for.


Quick guide on how to read the letter notes


Each group of letter notes is played from left to right, and vertical letters on the same column are played together.


The numbers in front of each line are the octave, each octave has an unique color so you can easily follow them.


Lowercase (a b c d e f g) letters are natural notes (white keys, a.k.a A B C D E F G ). 
Uppercase (A C D F G) letters are the sharp notes (black keys a.k.a. A# C# D# F# G#), look at the image below to see where each letter note is on the piano keyboard.


The lines / dashes (-) between letters indicates timing to play the notes. Just listen to the audio file at the top of the post to figure out the time lenght of the dashes (usually 5-6 dashes is about 1 second)


RH / LH means Right Hand / Left Hand and it's mostly for people who play the piano, it tells them with what hand to play the lines. Also, if you want to play a easy version of the song, playing only the RH lines does exactly that, because on most songs RH notes are for melody and LH notes are for bass.
