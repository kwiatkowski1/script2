THE SIMS 4 MONEY CHEATS AND MUST HAVE MODS


You won’t get far in The Sims 4 without Simoleons. In fact if you’re not taking care of business you’ll get your utilities shut down, won’t be able to buy food, and eventually starve to death. Luckily there are ways to survive, but with the info below your Sims will live a life of luxury if you want.


The Sims 4 Money Cheats (Unlimited Money)  Before you can use the cheat codes you’ll need to bring up the Cheat Console. Hold down the following 3 keys on your keyboard at the same time, Ctrl + Shift + C. A white text box will appear at the top of the screen. Enter any of the cheats codes below:


KACHING – $1000 
ROSEBUD – $1000 
MOTHERLODE – $50000


TESTINGCHEATS TRUE (PRESS ENTER) – Type the word MONEY (the amount of money you want up to $9999999)


Don’t have enough Simoleons for the house you want when starting the game? Use this cheat.


FREEREALESTATE ON – All lots are free


The Sims 4 Money Mods


For Sims who are struggling a little, this mod functions like all rabbit hole careers except you don’t have to work. You’ll basically have to go to the welfare office for 1 hour to get your weekly $600 check.


Sims with extremely thoughtful parents or family can get access to their Trust Fund on a weekly basis. This is another career mod where you only have to go get your money every week.


You no longer have to worry about finances when a household member passes away with this mod. You’ll be covered. The amount you get will vary from $20,000 to $100,000.


Why not get all the things your Sim wants with a little credit from SimCity Loans. You can get a loan worth up to $500,000 with a low 5% interest rate. No interest due if you pay the loan back in one full payment. If loans become overdue your Sim will get a stress buff that will remain until the loan is completely paid in full.


 
There are a lot of really cool features with this mod. It will give you realistic bills to pay. There are two versions to consider. The public free version and the Patreon version. The Patreon version will have more features or offer them there first before becoming free.


Each Sim in your household will get their own banking account. Now funds can be separated. When moving into your house you’ll need to pay to have the utilities turned on. Please be aware that a game patch is coming similar to the way this works and the mod may change in the future. A financial institution is planned for the future as well.
