Jewelry Store Robbery


Emergency Response- Liberty County - Rob the jewelry store tutorial!


Official tutorial on how to rob the jewelry store.


The Jewelry Store Robbery is a robbery released on July 6, 2020. The robbery allows players to rob cases in the Jewelry Store.


Description


The Jewelry Store can be robbed using the Drill, which can be purchased for $1,000 in the Tool Store. In order to rob a case, equip the Drill in the inventory, approach one of the cases in the store, and click the interaction key. Since the Drill lasts for 4 attempts, players can rob 4 different cases at once. Each case will give players anywhere between $800–1,400, with an average reward of $1,000.


Once robbed, the store will sound an alarm, regardless of the player's success. This will alert law enforcement as well.


Process


In order to successfully complete the robbery, the criminal must play a minigame. The minigame requires the player to keep a bar in the center in the green area for 20 seconds. This can be done by continuously clicking the screen to prevent the bar from going too far to the left or right. As the game continues, the red area will move closer to the center


Similar to other robberies, once robbed, the player must stay alive in the game for 4 minutes without dying, leaving the game, switching teams, or being arrested.

Edit to add I’m using the Vive pre-order edition. Intel i7-6700K, 32GB RAM, Win 10 64, GTX 1080, game was installed on an SSD. I hate to give negative reviews, but this isn’t even worth it if it were offered for free. The controls don’t work and I’m always moving backwards even when I place the apparatus in park. The controls overall are terrible and there are simple spelling mistakes that just echo the poor quality control. I wasn’t expecting a lot but being a fire fighter in real life, I was wishing to at least pull a line from the pumper panel and put the wet stuff on the red stuff but was never able to. The map is really bland and empty. Again, I hate giving bad reviews but when you’re asking people to pay money for this they should expect something playable in return. I own plenty of games that started out poorly but I could see potential in them. I hope the devs can turn this around but I think it’s a Hail Mary pass that I’m not willing to invest in. And for that reason, I’m out. More of a concept of a game idea right now than game, makes an early access title looked well finished. Needs a lot more work before it should even be on the Steam Store. Great idea though but too early Dev and at that price you have to be taking the mick.
