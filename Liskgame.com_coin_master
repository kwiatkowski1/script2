Coin Master free spins & coins links (April 2023)


Today’s working Coin Master free spins and coin links — updated daily!


The main objective of Coin Master is building your village by spinning a slot machine and collecting coins to buy upgrades. Additionally, you can raid and attack other players’ villages to steal some of their coins. Random events and other mechanics, like card collecting, tournaments, and pet management, also add some variety.


Once you have used all of your free spins in Coin Master for the day, you will have to purchase spins or coins with real money to continue upgrading your village. Spending real money is not practical for everyone or even necessary if you know where to look. That’s where these daily links for free coins and spins come in. Below we have a full list of Coin Master free spins and coins daily links! Extra online spins links are a safe way to get additional coins.

The actual coin payoff you receive from these links will vary depending on your level. The spins seem to remain the same regardless of level, but the coins will vary. For instance, at lower levels, we got 600,000 instead of 1 million, but at later levels, we received 1.2 million. Some very high-level players have even reported up to 25 million coins per link.


Tip: When switching back and forth from this article to Coin Master, leave the game on the village screen instead of the spin screen to speed up the process since you won’t have to wait for the +10 spins animation to play before claiming the next code.


Typically, free spins and coins links expire after a day or two, but just in case they’re still working, we’ll leave the last few weeks’ links below.

Our guide is full of new Coin Master free spin links for today, as well as some tips and tricks for the smash hit mobile game from Moon Active.


Wondering how to get Coin Master free spins? You’ve come to the right place. This is an addictive mobile game by design. It combines the thrill of playing slots with the social battling of Clash of Clans to create something that you just can’t put down; in a good way. The problem is, you so often have to put it down if you’re not willing to fork out the cash for regular spins. That’s understandable when as little as 30 spins will set you back £1.99 in the UK or $1.99 in the US.


In this Coin Master blog, we’re going to provide you with all of the ways you can get your hands on a few free spins and a Coin Master bonus here and there. This will allow you to continue playing long after your daily free spins run out, and provide you with the means of getting extra, without the need to spend your hard-earned money on premium spins in the game’s store. We’d also recommend checking out our Coin Master free cards and Coin Master free coins guides to get even more rewards, and our Pet Master free spins guide if you fancy checking out Moon Active’s latest game.

How can I get Coin Master free spins?


Here are a bunch of tips to help you get even more free spins in Coin Master.


Follow Coin Master on social media


Each day, Moon Active, Coin Master’s developer, provides a bunch of links that you can follow to get your hands on Coin Master free spins. If you keep on top of this, you can get a steady stream of free stuff for very little effort. You can follow Coin Master on Facebook or Twitter.


Want more? Check out CodesDb for a powerful, searchable database of the latest game codes. 


Sign up for email gifts


If you sign up for email gifts, you can get yourself a handful of Coin Master free spins every single day just by following a link on your phone. We haven’t encountered any spam from signing up so far either, so it’s a quick and easy method of getting yourself some tasty free spins.


Invite friends


Each time you invite a friend who successfully joins Coin Master through Facebook, you’ll get 40 Coin Master free spins, which is considerable. They don’t even have to actually play the game; they simply have to download it and log in via their Facebook account to get you the free spins. Of course, it’s in both your interests to actually play it, which brings us nicely to our next point.


Request spins as gifts


You can get up to 100 Coin Master free spins per day from friends, though to get to those heights you’ll need 100 active friends who are kind enough to send you a gift each day. Each gift consists of a single free spin.


Unless you’re incredibly popular, it’s highly unlikely that you’ll have 100 friends; let alone 100 that will actually deign to play a game with you. We recommend heading on over to the official Reddit community or Facebook communities to try and find people willing to play with you.


Watch video ads


You can get a limited number of Coin Master free spins per day by watching a video ad. Simply scroll to the slot machine and tap on the spin energy button on the bottom right. If it’s not there, you’ve run out of free spins you can get through this method for the day, but if it is, simply tap on it and you’ll watch an ad.


Spin


Ironically, you can actually get a ton of Coin Master free spins by, well, spinning. If you get three spin energy symbols in a row, you’ll get a bunch of free spins. Pick up a chain of them and you can spin for ages before you run out.


Level up your village


Each time you level up your village, you’ll get a bunch of Coin Master free spins. It’s not easy though, as it costs a considerable amount of gold to purchase new buildings and improve them, and you have to purchase every single one of them, including improvements, to level up. That’s going to cost a lot of spins, as it is.


Looking for a new game? Take a look at our Free Fire redeem codes, My Singing Monsters breeding guide, or even our Pokédex! 


Participate in events


There’s almost always at least one event happening in Coin Master, and it can absolutely shower you with free spins. While viewing the slot machine, look at the top right of the screen. Any virtual buttons that you can see beneath the menu (which is displayed as three lines) are an event. Tap on one and you’ll see what each event involves.


Take advantage of these events and you can get yourself a lot more Coin Master free spins than usual.


Wait


This is an obvious suggestion, but it’s actually worth taking into consideration. You get five free spins every single hour, and you can only hold a maximum of 50 spins at any one time. That means every ten hours you’ll hit the maximum number of spins, and any Coin Master free spins you would have earned after that will cease to exist.


So, we recommend setting a reminder to visit Coin Master every ten hours at least to spend your spins so you are always earning more. You’ll actually end up earning a huge number of extra spins if you’re dedicated, so it’s totally worth doing.
