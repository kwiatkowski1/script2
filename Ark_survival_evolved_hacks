Ark: Survival Evolved cheats and console commands


Cheat codes for Ark on PC: use god mode, fly, teleport, unlock all engrams, tame dinos, and more.


If you're looking to enhance your dinosaur survival adventure, do it with Ark cheats. Ark: Survival Evolved is a sandbox, after all, so you might as well play around in it. Ark cheats let you enter all sorts of console commands to enable god mode, level up instantly, teleport, spawn items, instantly tame dinosaurs, unlock all the engrams, and more.


Ark cheats are primarily used in singleplayer mode, but you can also use them in multiplayer if you're the server admin or if you've been given access to the server admin password. Otherwise you can't use cheats while playing online. And if you're looking for other ways to enhance Studio Wildcard's dino survival game, don't forget to check out list of the best Ark mods.


Below you'll find cheats for Ark the base game, and some for Ark: Genesis that will work with the new dinosaurs and items added in Ark's latest expansion.


How to use Ark cheats


You can access the console in Ark by pressing the Tab keyâ€”you'll see a narrow box open at the very bottom of your screen. That's where you'll be typing in the cheats. To close the console, press Tab again.


In singleplayer mode, just type the cheats to enable them. In multiplayer, if you have the admin password, you'll need to type 'EnableCheats ' before you can use cheats. Some cheats (while playing on a server) will require the prefix 'admincheat'. In singleplayer, you don't need to worry about a prefix. Just type them and press Enter.


The cheats are written in bold below (and they're not case-sensitive).
