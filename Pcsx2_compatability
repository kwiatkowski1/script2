Pcsx2 compatability

The Situation 
For anyone unaware, PSX (aka PS1) games are bootable as of the 1.5.0 development series and into newer PCSX2 versions. You can now use your PSX games in PCSX2 and expect some kind of response.


However, there are still some components that are incomplete, or not working fully. Issues include but are not limited to boot failures, graphics corruption, FMV corruption, missing or corrupted audio, inability to read memory cards, or unresponsive controls. So, we have an unofficial list here of what games work and what doesn't.


The PCSX2 community does not yet officially support PSX games. Any issues you encounter may be discussed freely, however no official support channels will help you with PSX problems. ALL bug reports for PSX games will be immediately closed as invalid.



  
Only PS2 BIOSes from original fat PS2's will be able to run PSX games. Due to the IOP changes Sony made on the slims, they simply won't run PSX games in PCSX2 right now. 

  
Audio will always be pitch-shifted a half step up, due to a rather complicated problem with sample rates. Resolved as of 1.7.0-dev-324! 

  
Just about every game will have some sort of distortion and/or corruption during FMVs, due to multiple DMA and PS1 GPU problems. 

  
PSX memory cards will appear in the PS2 BIOS as Pocketstation devices. This is due to a hack that was required for some Pocketstation compatible games to detect memory cards, and is strictly a visual side-effect with no performance or compatibility issues. 



  
IOP Interpreter often fixes boot failures among other problems. Don't worry about speed, the IOP Interpreter is surprisingly quick for an interpreter and as long as your CPU is at or above PCSX2's recommended CPU rating, you should be able to run this. 

  
Use a Software renderer, instead of a Hardware renderer. If this doesn't immediately solve the issue, reboot the game with the Software renderer already selected. Again, don't worry about speed here, the amount of GPU work is minimal and should be a non-issue for PCs that meet PCSX2's CPU requirements. 

  
Sometimes a game may not format a PSX memory card correctly. Try booting to the PS2 BIOS to format memory cards instead. 

  
Eject any PS2 memory cards. 

  
Lower the EE cyclerate. Doesn't seem to have any negative consequences, this tends to just speed games up. 





  
Playable: You can get from 'new game' to 'end credits' (regardless of speed). 

  
Ingame: You can get through menus, intro cutscenes / videos, and see ingame graphics, but either due to graphical bugs, crashes, un-resolved errors, you can't play through the entire game. 

  
Menus: You can get into the menus, be it past 3D / video intro, memcard checks etc, but when starting a new game, it will lock up, crash, enter a loop etc. 

  
Intro: The game will show 2D logos, or video, but will not get into menus. This could be one screen, or 20, but won't show much. 

  
Nothing: Exactly what it says, this game crashes before showing any graphics, making any sound etc
