In Fortnite aiming like a pro is a key to win the game, in this kind of Battle Royale game where timing and speed is everything, you have to be highly accurate. The game demands strategy and speed side-by-side, if you are just running like a chicken you can be a playful target for skillful players around you.

It not that complicated, all you need is to focus for a moment, anyhow it is not right to say that a battle royale game is truly predictable. A lot of things relies on the players and scenario.


Best Aiming Tips – How To Shoot Like A Pro


Aiming will take time, it is not like you learn that instantly after playing a handful of matches and getting use the weapons your aiming skills will definitely improve, but following the below tips will help you to achieve this goal faster.


1). Move Sensitivity:


If you are playing on a PC or Laptop then first thing to adjust is to get the best mouse sensitivity. This thing is applicable to all shooting games like Counter-Strike or COD. Mouse sensitivity let you to move the weapons corsair really fast in different direction. If this is out of your control then you are just spraying bullets in the air. If you keep the same low then the aiming response time is less, but you get a bit of perfection here. Remember not to keep this too low or to high the best settings it to find something in between so that you can spot a player and then instantly aim your weapon on this head. Test with different settings and use the one that suits you the best.


2). Pause & Shoot:


Don’t spray around, it is of no use instead shoot and wait for one second and then shoot. Your weapon recoil time is also added to this, and it will affect your aim stability. Once you spot a player the first thing you have to do is find a cover, if not then try moving at a reasonable speed and then aim and shoot. Wait and aim and shoot, there are maximum chances that you will hit the player. If you have a cover then you get more time. A full auto weapon can’t assure you accuracy slowly with time your hand, eye co-ordination will be perfect and without wasting much time you can instantly shoot players around you.


3). Focus More On Crouching:


Instead of jumping try to work more on crouching, jumping will put your aim out of focus and you will need some time to reset it back to the target. That’s the window where anyone can shoot you. So it is better to focus more on crouching. It has its own benefits, first thing when you crouch you are slower and your weapon accuracy specially using a medium-range assault rifle increases. By crouching you can stabilize yourself and you can spend more on aiming. Also keep a watch on the crosshair, its size shrinks when you aim while sitting and increases when you aim while jumping. The target must be always inside the circle.


4). Weapon Range:


Now this is as important as shooting with a short pause, because this will determine if you get a headshot or not. First thing you are having a weapon so you can stay away from a player, second if you are really far away then your bullet damage is reduced. This is a key to be a pro player where you have to maintain a good range and shoot for max damage. However it is hard to explain how to achieve it, because there are many things relies on this your movement, your comfort of using a weapon, knowledge of surrounding, etc. Still look your weapon stats, there is a Range section. This will tell you which happens gives you a good range. For example Assault Rifle, Machine Guns and Light Machine Guns offers you the highest range.


5). Target Neck & Shoulder:


After spotting a enemy your first action will be to move your corsair to the head and shoot. But there is a catch here, if the target is too far there are max chances that you might miss. If you see a really small head somewhere try to hit the neck or shoulders. This will help you to get a headshot, and if you are trying to hit a moving target then try to shoot a little left or right ahead instead of hitting the exact moving point. It is because there is a small time delay between the target movement and the bullet speed, so if you point a bit ahead of left or right direction you get more aiming accuracy. This is not applicable on slow targets.


If you shooting is really good and you are in full control then your chances to reach the last man standing list increases to 50%. That’s because you know when to shoot and get a sure shot kill. It is always good to go with a defensive strategy that means don’t jump into a battle if there is a fight going on. Let others clear your path by shooting themselves so you have less competition.


Fortnite gyro controls: The best settings and how to turn it on


Gyro controls have now been added to Fortnite, offering players a new way to aim when battling for a victory royale. There are two new options players can choose from, including gyro aiming and flick stick, all with the goal of removing players' reliance on the right stick of their controller.


Here's what you need to know about Fortnite's gyro controls, how to turn them on, and what controllers support them.


How to turn on gyro aiming in Fortnite


To turn on gyro aiming and flick stick in Fortnite, simply go to your settings menu. Select the new "Touch and Motion" sub-menu, where you'll find all the toggles you need. Switch "gyro aiming" from off to on.


You can also toggle when gyro aiming is in effect. If you prefer to only have it on while aiming, select "scope" or "scope and aiming" to apply it to non-scoped weapons. If you prefer to have it always on, even when just running around the map, select "always." You can similarly turn gyro aiming on and off for building structures.


How to turn on flick stick in Fortnite


In the same menu as gyro aiming, look further down to find the flick stick toggle. Flick stick allows you to immediately turn in a cardinal direction with the flick of just one stick. So if you're sick of always being gunned down from behind and want to give enemy players what for, a flick stick setup will let you automatically turn 180 degrees backwards with just one stick motion.


You'll still have to aim properly from there, but the faster reaction can give you more of a fighting chance.


What controllers work with gyro aiming in Fortnite?


Bad news for Xbox controller users, which means a whole lot of PC players. Xbox controllers don't include gyro functionality, unlike their Sony and Nintendo brethren. So you can't use gyro aiming, unfortunately.


If you use a Sony controller or play Fortnite on the Switch, though, you're in luck. Here's what's compatible with gyro aiming in Fortnite.



  
PC: DualShock 4 or DualSense controller

  
PS4: DualShock 4 controller

  
PS5: DualSense controller

  
Switch: Joy-Con or Pro Controller

  
Android: Mobile controls.

Fortnite gyro controls: Best settings


Here are the options you have to choose from while configuring Fortnite's gyro controls:


Active Combat (Combat)


None: Gyro controls are disabled for all gameplay 
Scope Only: Gyro controls are only enabled when using a scoped weapon 
Scope or Aiming: Gyro controls are enabled when aiming with either a scoped weapon or a non-scoped weapon 
Scope, Aiming, or Harvesting: Adds gyro to the above and when you're using your pickaxe's melee 
Always: Gyro is enabled at all times


Active Mode (Building)


None: Gyro disabled for all building 
Editing: Uses gyro when editing structures, not building 
Always: Uses gyro when either building or editing structures


I recommend keeping gyro aiming to "scope or aiming" since having gyro enabled at all times could lead to some. interesting camera issues if you're a fidgety player. If for any reason you find the gyro aiming uncomfortable, setting the look stick effect (a separate setting, not to be confused) to "disabled" will let you automatically take control with the right stick in the traditional way.

PC gamers always complain about aim assist in multiplayer games with cross-platform support. This is because they believe that this mechanic helps console gamers more than necessary. While this is sometimes true, the advantage still lies with players using a mouse.

Enable “Use Advanced Options” by selecting “On”.

  
Scroll down and find the “Advanced – Sensitivity” section.

  
Set “Aim Assist Strength” to 100% in this section.

  
Save the settings and return to the game.




When you enable the advanced settings, dozens of additional settings will open up that will change the way you aim with your gamepad. It’s wise not to play with them too much, because the game’s default settings are pretty good. However, you can’t only use the aim assist, but also try different settings to find the most accurate averages for you.

While it doesn’t offer much of an advantage to console players, it does help eliminate some of the PC player superiority. You can already feel it when you use this setting.
