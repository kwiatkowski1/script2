Is there an elixir cheat?


Both a friend and I have come across situations where it appears our opponent is cheating.


E.g. a Pekka and golem being played at the virtually the same time (and with no elixir generators on the field)


Has anyone come across something similar? Are we both perhaps just misremembering. If it happens again how can I post replay?


watch the replay if you think they cheat somehow. The only people on here that say someone cheat go back and rewatch only to find out they were incorrect


The “replays” are made with an algorithm and don’t actually show what really happened. If a player is using a cheat where they have more elixir, the algorithm won’t have it and the replay will look different in a way that shows a legal amount of elixir was used but your stuff will die faster and sometimes for no reason… it’s a strange thing to see, but pretty common if you pay attention.


This is impossible, they probably just slow-rolled the golem and placed pekka when they reached 7 elixir


Watch the replay. You will soon realize you were wrong
