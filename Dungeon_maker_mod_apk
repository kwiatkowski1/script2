# In Dungeon Maker, players take on the role of a craftsman in a fantasy world who creates dungeons for monsters to live in.


The dungeon is a place of darkness where devils and shadow often hide. Entering this legendary place is only for the most courageous heroes. Very few people can leave this dungeon, and when they do, it’s usually with severe injuries. People often think of Dungeons as a role-playing game where you fight monsters and protect the kingdom from chaos. Many video games and board games encourage players to work alongside the knights in the dungeons to overcome monsters. However, have you ever chosen to stand against the evil side and believed that the devils are only trying to defend their homeland? New game from publisher GameCoaster— Play Dungeon Maker! This game features unique strategies for fighting against the bosses and the devil in order to protect the Dungeon Maker's lair from attacks by knights.


# Plot


People have no effect on the lives of devils, who live happily in their dungeons. The Dark Lord watches over all demons and monsters, ruling their lives with ease. The Dark Lord must always be prepared for war. Whenever humans invade his territory, he must rally his troops and prepare to confront them. Although he loathes war, the Dark Lord has no choice but to prepare for a conflict with invading humans. Because they will inevitably charge headlong into death.


# Gameplay


From a gameplay perspective, Dungeon Makers combines both a turn-based combat strategy game and a tower defense game. The player controls monsters that summon for each turn to defend against the attacks of castle knights. The Dark Lord lurks at the center of the dungeon, and players must defeat him to complete the game. Beautiful girls are the Dark Lord's fierce foes in this game. The Dark Lord is not a dragon or a group of monsters; he is a woman. When you let one of his followers get defeated, your dungeon will permanently close. Although the Dark Lord is resilient to injury, she will eventually lose energy and become vulnerable. Consequently, it's imperative to find creative ways to protect her from harm. A 36-square map features three vertical rows and twelve horizontal sections. Like in the video game Plants Vs Zombies, heroes march in a rigid formation to confront the dark lord. They need to fortify their position with strategically positioned defenses and call upon summoned monsters to defeat them. In order to plan out your battles, you’ll need to choose between monsters, traps and where to place them. There is no single formula for victory; you’ll have to figure out the best method after each loss. Currently, the game has two main modes of play: Normal Mode and Total War.


# Infuse the Dark Lord with power and unlock its abilities.


The first few levels present very little challenge. As you progress through the game and gain new levels, your enemies become increasingly powerful and adaptive to your defenses. You should match two monsters to create a stronger one. Doing this increases the entire squad's stats. Players enjoy unlocking Dark Lord and enemy monsters once they begin playing Dungeon Maker. Players can acquire eggs that contain summoned monsters by exploring the game's universe. The Dark Lord you can pick from includes Emma, Lilith, Rebecca, and Elizabeth as a vampire. Each has different powers and abilities to choose from. These abilities include the ability to slow down enemy movement and the ability to attack enemies. Lillith can use her abilities to draw enemies to her side or cause them to fight each other. You can choose her lord based on your strategic needs.


# Graphics


Google Play's Dungeon Maker is one of the best strategy games. However, it only uses 2D classic pixel graphics. Its game board is designed like a chessboard. Playing the game feels like reliving the past through older console games. It has unique graphics and images that can’t be compared to any modern top strategy games. Additionally, the game is addictive and has a nostalgic feel.


# MOD features many unique characteristics.


# A concise description of the game is usually included in the box.


In Dungeon Maker, you become the ruler of a dark dungeon by using a specific card. You will choose cards at random, and enemies and traps are also randomized. To improve your odds of winning, you need to regularly practice playing the game. By using traps and monsters strategically, you can protect your Dark Lord from attackers. Monsters stand in the center of battle rooms, blocking the paths of approaching heroes to either side and in the middle. They counter enemy spells with destructive powers, eliminating each opponent until only one remains. Monsters can learn up to four skills; the most a given one can have is 50. They also gain 2 more skills if they develop to level 50. This process takes a lot of hard work and dedication.


# How to Play Beginners is included in the Learn to Play Set.


At the beginning of Dungeon Maker, the lord does not have a protective creature to protect him; he only controls a small area with few obstacles. The only way to defeat enemies during this phase is by following the directions on the game's screen. Each lord has their own unique attack skills like one who needs to use more strength when fighting the enemy or someone who can improve their monster's trap defense abilities. They can also help transmit power to their creature in order to survive. Correctly setting up traps and monsters in your dungeon is vital to your success; this is why many consider it to be the difference between life and death. After each victory, scoop up Relics. These mystical items provide benefits during battle, such as increased Mana or stats for the Dark Lord. They also increase EXP points. Plus, they allow you to purchase upgrades that grant additional benefits.


# FEATURES


The game Dungeon Maker boasts an expansive range of content. It features over 260 monsters, 260 relics and traps, 260 heroes, 10 dark lords with special skills, more than 240 vehicles and more than 160 traps in its dungeon. Its content is also highly creative and interesting, so it’s unlikely players will get bored. Additionally, the game hosts many different surprises that have not yet been unlocked. The game always existso offers an equally interesting feature: you know your fate in advance after daily draws; it will be done according to what you want: fight or rest.

How to Play Dungeon Maker?


The type of game is rogue-like plus development. The art style is a side ball that evokes our original memory and excites us more than the real-life color map. The player plays the role of the dark lord, commanding monsters, and crusades against the brave in a dungeon composed of rooms.

The core of Dungeon Maker is the skills of monsters and the resource allocation around monsters and skills. They divide the skills in Dungeon Maker into two types.



  
Personality skills: unique to each monster;

  
Common skills: a large skill pool shared by all monsters;




It limited the skills that each monster can equip. You can sacrifice the monster to get equipment with its skills. And we can gain other common skills through inheritance and randomness. There are links between unique skills, and there are almost no skills that simply enhance monster attributes.

And then enter the game practice, the strategy is more difficult.
