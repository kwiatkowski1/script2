Storyline


The story in 9th Dawn III is set in the land of Cedaltia. It is a beautiful land with diverse landscapes. However, this kingdom has an evil king and many different monsters. Therefore, people's lives are becoming more and more miserable.


One day, a hero was born. He is destined to defeat the king and destroy the monsters to bring happiness to his people.


Gameplay


In 9th Dawn III, you will play a hero. Initially, you will wake up in a village called Agaria. Your mission is to travel to many places to destroy monsters to protect innocent people.


"Read Sign" and "Blood-Spawn" are two things you should keep in mind. The Read Sign, in particular, serves as a guide and instructs you on what to do. Blood-Spawn, on the other hand, are Checkpoints. If a monster kills you, you will be resurrected here. Keep in mind that you may come across wooden boxes on your journey. They could include items, materials, or equipment. You can gather them.


Then you will leave Agaria and travel to new lands such as Ashwick or the Vlak forest. There are numerous dangers there, ranging from ancient creatures to goblins and giants. You will be faced with more than 270 different races. To restore peace to Cedaltia, you must defeat all of them.


In general, when you leave the village of Agaria, the more monsters appear, while they tend to be stronger. Therefore, you have to be careful with places like dark areas, caves, dungeons, and forests because you cannot know what's going on there.


Weapon System


A hero will require weapons and equipment to survive and defeat monsters. Bows, crossbows, axes, and swords are just a few examples of weapons. Each weapon grants you a unique set of abilities. You must select the appropriate weapon for each situation.


Furthermore, 9th Dawn III includes various defense tools such as armor, shoes, rings, and so on. They not only protect the main character but also contribute to having a distinct appearance.


Skill System


Many people might think 9th Dawn III RPG is a simple game. However, when you explore the character's skill system, you will realize that that is not true.


The game has only three classes of main characters, including knights, archers, and mage. But each of them has a system of 6 skill types: Melee Combat, Ranged Combat, Magic Combat, Defensive, Misc, and Crafting. As you fight, you can develop your skills for more chances to win.

9th Dawn RPG +


Are you a fan of oldschool RPGs like Ultima, but crave the openness and exploration in modern games? If so, we at Valorware are dedicated to giving you just that! We are proud to present 9th Dawn, a game that's a blend of modern and traditional design and gameplay and sports the largest open world experience available today in a mobile RPG! 


Explore the large island continent of Montelorne, a land far detached from the mainland, but filled with mystery, danger, and last but not least, adventure. You begin your journey in the small village of Agaria, but once you gain your bearings, you'll find yourself immersed in a world of its own. 


Play as one of three of the traditional classes: The sturdy knight, skilled in the art of combat and possessing the ability to wield heavy armour and weapons; the nimble archer, capable of swiftly dispatching a foe from afar or up close with his daggers; the wise mage, master of the elements and capable of utilizing powerful magic spells and summoning abilities to obliterate the enemy.


Whether it's searching for hidden artifacts and treasure, helping the troubled Montelornians with the rising undead armies, or simply exploring the massive world and its many towns, dungeons, and forests, there is no shortage of fun for a bold adventurer to partake of!


We would personally like to thank all of our supporters and players, whether they be from our failed Kickstarter campaign, a fan of our tech demo that we released some months back, or a family member or friend. It is your interest and support that has driven this project and gotten us to this point in the game's development. It may have taken us a bit longer, but we are proud to present the game to you all as it is now.


If you are uncertain of purchasing right now, feel free to check out the free version of the game! The free version contains all of the features of the full game; it just limits you to a small portion of the world map.


We are currently aware of some issues which affect framerate and loading times. If you encounter a long loading time or black screen, give it some time. Mobile phones have not quite caught up yet for such an open world, expansive map system, but we are making efforts to enhance the performance experience and will be adding options to enhance performance on lower end phones in the future. Note: We do not guarantee support for resolutions below 320x480, but the game should run great on tablets.

This game requires around 130MB of available RAM to play. If you do not have the required amount of available memory, the game may crash (at startup or in game), display a black screen, or have no graphics because there isn't enough memory to load them. There is nothing we can really do about this, since htis is how much memory is necessary to load the media and content of the game.
