8 Best & Free Online Android Emulator Apps for PC


Want to run Android games and apps on your PC? Read this article till the end to learn about the top 6 free online Android emulator apps you can use to do that.


With just a few clicks on the internet, you’ll find a myriad of free online emulators – all claiming to be the best in the business. Android emulators in practice mimic your Android smartphone to give you a better experience on your PC.


But unfortunately, many of them don’t tend to work as advertised and do no purpose except for wasting your time. Given this, we have done comprehensive research and come up with a list of the most popular phone emulators in 2022 that can use without any technical hassles.


Part 1. Top 8 Online Android Emulators in 2023


1 ApkOnline


ApkOnline comes preloaded with all the amazing features that exist in an Android device, making it one of the best Android emulators. It’s easy to use, has no compatibility issues, and allows users to test Android applications without access to the real hardware.


Thanks to the Android Virtual Device (AVD) running in its cloud software platform, ApkOnline is a fast, safe, and reliable tool to emulate calls, messages, device location, hardware sensors, and Google Play Store.


Being one of the top Android emulators, ApkOnline has gained worldwide traction and boasts a huge list of satisfied customers. It has limited features but its ease of use and intuitive interface covers most of its cons.


2 Appetize.io


Another popular free Android emulator tool requires users to sign up before accessing the service. Like other emulators, it lets you run native iOS and Android mobile apps directly in your browser.


Its interface is simple and basic and doesn’t support many applications – which makes it a preferable choice for beginners while professional developers have to rely on other Android emulators to get the job done.


What’s best about Appetize.io is it comes with a free plan and offers 100 free minutes each month which makes it one of the best emulators for PC.


This tool has gotten a mixed reaction from users. Going through its reviews, it can be concluded that Appetize.io is a handy tool for basic development but it isn’t a preferable choice for high-end app development.


3 BlueStacks


BlueStacks is one of the best free online Android emulator players that has left tails wagging in the market due to its reliability and performance. This powerful app was developed primarily for games and that’s why its main interface is virtually a front end for downloading and installing your favorite Android games.


Use standalone APK files if you want to add games from sources other than the Google Play Store. Available in both free and paid versions, BlueStacks is a great way to bring your Android games to a bigger screen.


Most users are satisfied with the product, terming its ease of use and high performance as the reasons to use it. However, it’s a games platform only and many users have complained of its annoying interface and poor performance on low-end PCs.


4 Genymotion


Equipped with tons of developer-friendly features, Genymotion is amongst the most powerful Android emulator to test out Android apps on PC. It offers greater flexibility to the users as its Windows app runs offline apart from online cloud services.


Note that it isn’t the first choice for Android gaming apps as it can’t install many games like PUBG, Call, or Duty. The best thing about Genymotion is that you can integrate it with Android Studio or Android SDK on your PC to develop Android apps smoothly. Even if the product is paid for, you get the first 1000 minutes for free.


Genymotion has proved to be a reliable Android emulator for development and has thousands of satisfied clients. But as it’s only targeted at developers, so people looking for an Android gaming experience can’t use it.


5 TestObject


Thanks to its cloud-based infrastructure, TestObject is one of the fastest free online Android emulator tools. All you need to do is create a new Test Object account and start using it. Its free plan allows users a 10-minute continuous usage of every app.


If ever you needed to use any app for more than the allowed time, simply quit the app and launch it again and drag and drop APK files to get started again.


This app isn’t as intuitive and user-friendly and has limited features. So, not many users are satisfied with its efficiency. In any case, it’s a reliable tool for app development.


6 NoxPlayer


If you want an Android emulator that offers a plethora of amazing features apart from emulating Android games on your PC, then NoxPlayer is your ideal choice. Having fast loading times even on low-end PCs, this amazing tool is easy to install and use for newbies.


Even though this emulator was developed primarily for installing and playing Android games on PC, it offers tons of Android applications as well. What distinguishes it from other tools is its compatibility with DirectX and OpenGL graphical settings, which allow users to manage the RAM and CPU power allocated to the virtual Android device.


Users have given mixed feedback on this product. Many users term it a worthy tool to play graphically demanding Android games smoothly, but others raised concerns about its security. Recently, it was hijacked by a hacker group.


7 Redfinger


Redfinger is a Cloud-based Android emulator. It offers native Android authentic experience. It's available on Windows, Android, and iOS.


Their service is usually good. However, there was once right after an update that I cannot connect to their server smoothly anymore. It was ridiculously slow on all my devices. I live in the US and use their US server. Both my home and office WIFI are unchanged and connect fast with all other websites. When that happened, the customer service was ridiculously unhelpful and blame it on my network service. After a few days, it was fixed. I'm pretty sure they figured it out eventually.


8 Droid4X


Droid4X Android simulator is used as an android emulator for Windows 10 PC and laptops. You can run popular Android games and apps on the Windows PC.


Flip easily between Windows an Android OS with ease and no performance degradation. Allows for hard or virtual (screen) keyboards, customize RAM and CPU's used, window size or full screen, swipe between Windows 10 and Droid4X, and allows for 1 folder share (local or LAN) as SD.


Part 2. Bonus: The Best Alternative for Android Emulator


Since the Android emulators are legal in certain conditions, here we recommend a wonderful iOS & Android mirroring application - iMyFone MirrorTo to you. iMyFone MirrorTo is totally legal in the market and is much easier than the emulators.


Mirror & Record Diablo Immortal on PC with iMyFone MirrorTo


iMyFone MirrorTo supports live streaming mobile games on PC in real-time. You can share your gameplay with others by mirroring it to a bigger screen of the computer. You can also play some mobile games on your computer with it because it also allows you to control your iPhone from PC and control Android from PC.

Freely control your Android device with a keyboard and mouse.

  
Play Android mobile games on PC without any lag, like PUBG game, Among Us, and ARK: Survival Evolved.
