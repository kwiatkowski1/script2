Call of Duty Vanguard Hacks/Cheats With Aimbot, ESP/Wallhack, and Radar Hack


From Modern Warfare to Black Ops Cold War , the Call of Duty series has been on a bit of a roll over the course of the past few years. While Black Ops Cold War had a few hiccups when it first launched, many of the series’s devoted fans have decided to give them game a pass due to the Coronavirus pandemic and its impact on the game’s development.


However, the next chapter in the Call of Duty franchise is here and it’s bringing gamers back to the era that started it all: World War II. In case you didn’t know, every Call of Duty title up until the fourth instalment (the original Modern Warfare) was based in World War II, and old-school gamers are always clamoring for the game to return to that era.


Over the years, there have been a few returns to the era of the Second World War, including the follow up to Call of Duty 4, Call of Duty World at War (which also introduces the beloved Zombies game mode). After that, the last return to this era was Call of Duty WWII, which received a mixed response.


Now that Call of Duty Vanguard is here, gamers are excited to see what it has in store. The game’s campaign features a return to the Eastern Front, showcasing the Battle of Stalingrad in its full horror and brutality. However, Activision has learned a few lessons from the most recent COD titles.


For example, Call of Duty Vanguard will be releasing with sixteen maps, which is a response to the disappointment of most players when they realized how few maps shipped with Black Ops Cold War. Along with that, Activision has taken note of the popularity of different game sizes in BOCW.


The action in Call of Duty Vanguard is now split into three distinct types of game modes in multiplayer. From largest to smallest, these are: Blitz, Tactical, and Assault. Blitz is a large-scale game mode reminiscent of Ground War from previous COD titles, so if you like chaos, this will be your go-to.


If you’re a fan of the traditional 6v6 experience in Call of Duty, don’t fret because it’s still there in the form of Tactical. Finally, you have Assault, which features lower player counts and smaller maps that will get you right back into the action soon after you die. This final mode promises to be a great choice for leveling weapons.


Activision is also doubling down on the inclusion of Operators in this title, and that comes as little surprise when you consider how much money they make off the microtransactions related to them. In fact, they’re going as far as including a separate leveling system and XP bar for Operators.

COD Warzone Wallhack Free


Wallhack was once a term used to denote cheating or glitching in a game that enabled players to illegally see other players through walls. This naturally led to easy kills and a sense of unfairness for the victims of them.
