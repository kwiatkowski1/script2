MegaBox HD


MegaBox HD is an app that lets you enjoy hundreds of movies and TV shows from your Android. You get to choose if you want to download or stream them. That way, you can also select if you want to watch your content in 360p, 720p or 1080p resolution.


The interface on MegaBox HD is very intuitive. Within the dropdown menu bar on the left you'll find easy access to movies and TV shows. Also, inside each category you'll be able to filter results by popularity, latest releases, and according to positive user reviews. Of course, you'll also get to choose if you want to use the search bar to look for a specific movie or TV show.


When tapping a movie or TV show, its poster will appear along with a short summary of its content. In the video tab you'll see all the available options that usually include links for different image quality (from 360p to 1080p). Here you'll also get to tick whether you want to watch it in streaming mode or download it for later.


MegaBox HD is an excellent app that lets you watch movies and series. Its biggest setback is that the player integrated within this app doesn't allow subtitles. Luckily, the app does let you play any content using other apps like MX Player or VLC, for example.
