What is a server side?


I've heard people talk about server sides but what is the difference between a normal executor and a server side?


This is all because of FE (Filtering Enabled), and what that does is make it so that the following happens:


Let's assume there are two clients (players) in a game, Client A and Client B.


Client A has an executor, and changes the color of a brick. Filtering Enabled checks if Client A has "network ownership" of that brick.
-If they do, then the changes are "replicated" to the server, and Client B will see the brick change color.
-If they don't, then nothing happens. Only Client A will see the brick change color.


By default, every client has network ownership of their own character, and only the server can change an object's network ownership. This is useful because if the player's internet slows down, then the objects they have network ownership of will still continue to function normally and won't look laggy.


So, what's a server-side? Because, in a game, the server can do anything, and any changes it makes are replicated to all clients in the game, if you manage to get a backdoor in a serverscript, you could do a ton more stuff, like unanchor the whole map.


But, backdoors can be hard to get into any game with a decent player count, so, it's not really worth your time.
