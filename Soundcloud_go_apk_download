[App] SoundCloud++ Link (Should be working!)


Hey guys I’ve seen lots of requests for a working SoundCloud++ IPA and lots of complaints about apps not working etc, so for those wondering please try this link and see if it works out for you guys. Please let me know if it works for you or not. Enjoy!


P.S. Also if you do have any issues with the app. Please let me know what device you are using and what iOS version your device is on and if you are jailbroken or not.


EDIT: Updated Link As of 11/21/2021. Credits To QN_ & AppDB!


Please use New Link Below! Thanks!


I was wondering it it will also work for Android aka Samsung or if u had a android Version


I think i still have a modded spotify dm me


No this will not work with Android. Android uses .APK files for their Apps. iOS uses .IPA files.


But you could try looking in some android/android rooting/ android sideloading subs. Or even find a legit YouTube user that covers stuff like this or even Google and find a legit android blog/forum or website that is dedicated to stuff like this. Just like how we have websites for iOS to download IPA files to download and install.


the links worked well and i got the app no problem, but what are the features


You can look them up, I personally don’t use SoundCloud.


None of these links are working for me


it doesn’t work for me. have you got a working ipa?


Any updates on a new app working in 2021?


I have not made an updated version of this yet. I’ve had some personal issues and surgery and treatments the last few months. If I find an updated version or get the time to make an updated version I will post it here or make a new post.


Is this available on AppDB, if not is there a way to install it through an AppDB subscription?


I don’t think there is a working SoundCloud++ at the moment. People are saying that something in the app isn’t showing up or something. But it does work other then the thing people reported. I still haven’t gotten around to try making a new SoundCloud++/modified app yet. But yes you can install the IPA file thru your AppDB Subscription.


Is it possible to host it in a different site? My provider doesn’t let me access it l


I’m working on making a new modified version some people were complaining about it not working properly.


if someone can build an IPA using SarahH/Hollr’s SC++ tweak and not Julio’s SClife tweak, it wouldn’t have the empty playlist bug


I might be able to make the custom IPA file for you guys on my Mac. If you can link me to Sarah’s/holler99 Tweak. I’ll do my best to make a tweaked IPA with the latest SoundCloud.


I personally don’t use SoundCloud, but I’ll do what I can to get a working Modified SoundCloud for you guys & gals.


soundcloud 5.44.1 from appDB doesn’t have this issue. everything else above does


Ah gotcha. Well thanks for reporting back. I personally don’t use SoundCloud. But I saw that everyone wanted it and was trying to find a working version. But I guess not. Sorry it’s not working properly.
