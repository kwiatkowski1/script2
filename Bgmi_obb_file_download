Battlegrounds Mobile India (BGMI) APK + OBB download link for Android


Krafton is available for you to check out in Battlegrounds Mobile India (BGMI). For those who typically download the game with APK files, the developers have gone out of their way to make them readily available directly on the Apple and Google Play stores. This is a much safer process to go through rather than using a third-party website or application. Here’s what you need to know about downloading the Battlegrounds Mobile India APK and OBB for Android and iPhone devices.


How to download the Battlegrounds Mobile India APK


Here’s the entire process you want to follow to download the APK file from the Battlegrounds Mobile India website.



  
Head over to the BGMI website, and pick how you want to download the APK. You can pick from the Apple or Google Play store. The entire size of the file should be close to 558 MB.

  
Once the install has finished, ensure you’ve gone into your settings to allow you to download unknown sources, which should be in your settings. You can do this before or after downloading the file. With the setting clicked on, fine the APK in the files you downloaded on your smartphone and install it.




After you’ve gone through this process, you will now have to choose to download a resource pack and an HD resource pack. Depending on the type of smartphone you have and how new it is, you may want to go with the standard option rather than the HD one.


Unfortunately, some players are encountering issues with these APK lines from the developers. Google Play has pulled this game from their store, preventing anyone from playing it, speculating many to believe the mobile game has been banned. We will update this guide if we learn further information, but the download instructions should remain the same should the game return to the Google Play storefront.
