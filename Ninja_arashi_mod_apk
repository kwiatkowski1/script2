His sadness makes him angrier and stronger, so he fights bravely to ensure that he can save his son from the devil.

The gameplay of Ninja Arashi is a good platformer. It has responsive controls as well as long and fluid jumps. Firstly, in terms of control, there are two arrows on your left-hand side to move left or right. Next, on your right-hand side, you will see four buttons that are used to do different commands. For instance, the jump button allows you to perform jumps or double jumps. To attack enemies, you can press the shruiken button. It is also used to uncover secret rooms or break vases and crates.


Accordingly, the Camo button, which seems to be an all-purpose tool, enables Arashi to change into another person or even object. The transformation depends on what he has been equipped with.

However, the Camo and sword buttons have cooldown times after being used. To minimize the cooldown time, you have to upgrade these skills, or you can spam them again and again.


During the rescue, Arashi is able to sustain one hit from traps or enemies. Therefore, to keep him survive, you have to use tools that are evaluated as numerous and creative.

Beautiful mobile gaming experience, a much awaited sequel, greatly done. It would be nice though if the dialogues Arashi used to say in the previous games when slaying enemies is brought back. Keep up the great work!
