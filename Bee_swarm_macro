Bee Swarm Simulator Macros & Functions


Our attempt at providing a powerful & easily extensible / editable function list for BSS beekeepers to create their own macros. Additionally, an open-source alternative to potentially dangerous compiled executables or less-powerful JitBit macros prevalent in the BSS community.



  
Easily configurable hotkeys, such as the default CTRL+P to play, CTRL+Q to stop

  
Reconnect to the game if you lost connection or the server restarted

  
Set cooldowns for any task (such as bug running every 20/30/60/any minutes, wealth clock every hour, ant pass every 2 hours) that persist through macro sessions

  
Place 1-4 sprinklers, jumping as necessary automatically

  
Support for emptying the hive balloon if desired

  
Fully configureable planter support & management including harvesting, replacing, and rotating them through fields defined in config.ini





  
Download & Install Autohotkey

  
Download this code and it's dependencies (Code -> Download ZIP) & unzip it into a directory of your choice.

  
Edit config.ini to your liking (NOT configuration.ahk - run reset config.ahk first if you don't have a config.ini file).

  
Put your sprinkler in the first slot of your hotbar ingame.

  
Run an included example such as sunf +bca.ahk or pine balloon.ahk or any user-created file, default hotkeys are CTRL+Q to stop, and CTRL+P to play.





  
Make sure your screen resolution is at least 800x600.

  
Make sure Windows Display Scaling is set to 100% (default).

  
If you have a dedicated GPU, make sure you don't have any settings enabled which change image fidelity (such as AI-powered resolution upscaling, system-wide anti-aliasing, etc.) - note that these are usually off by default.

  
Any of the three above issues can cause repeated reconnections due to the functions not properly detecting if you're connected or in-game, and you may have to recapture or resize the pictures inside the errors and images folders.

  
If your wind shrine donations aren't functioning properly, you may need to recapture wind_shrine_next_item.png due to the way roblox draws this character differently for every resolution.

  
Make sure you have your sprinkler in the first slot, and have edited config.ini

  
You can try running the reset config.ahk file and re-editing the fresh config.ini if these functions worked for you in the past but stopped working.





  
Browse through the comments inside functions.ahk to create your own macro, or take a look at the implementation in the included examples for ideas or inspiration. For example, the sunf +bca macro: 

  
Reconnects if disconnected

  
Activates the Wealth Clock every hour

  
Uses the free Ant Pass dispenser every 2 hours

  
Kills & loots Mondo Chick (make sure your system time is set correctly if you do this)

  
Does a bug run every 30 minutes, turning in polar bear quests & killing vicious bees on the way through 

  
Note: See the warnings in functions.ahk



  
Activating Beesmas machines

  
Placing, harvesting, looting, and rotating planters through fields as defined in config.ini

  
Donating to the Wind Shrine & activating a field booster

  
Farming Pine Tree Forest in a unique way designed for using the Tide Popper




Using natro macro on E_lol, whats going on?

Its happened with multiple fields too, pine i walk into the corner and stuff


Field drift, there's no real way to fix it if you don't have ss but you could try different patterns that might minimise the time you end up away from the field


Probably too slow. Their gear makes them go faster, so itâ€™s equipped for them
