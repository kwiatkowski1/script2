For professional gamers, the name Nintendo is no stranger. This is a famous game company that has released legendary games like Mario, Pokemon. Previously, its games could not be played on mobile. Instead, only the company’s game consoles can meet this. The company’s “Gameboy” game console has a fairly large amount of money. Therefore, not all players can own this device. This is the reason, Citra Emulator emulator software appeared. The open data project on GitHub Cintra is contributed by many developers.

Up to now, Citra Emulator has been able to “weigh” most of its games with a fairly smooth experience.

This experience is completely free. You just need to download the game at the site that provides ROMs and then use the Citra Emulator application to open the game. This has many benefits, but also has some limitations. The reason is that game developers sell products for revenue. So, if you use it for free, the developer is the one who suffers.

Citra Emulator


Citra is a Nintendo 3DS emulator for Android that's capable of running tons of games from this console's catalog at full speed. This is the developer's first official public version after several forks or versions modified by third parties have popped up. It compiles some of the features implemented by the other versions and unifies them in a common project that, after several years of upgrades, has finally reached its prime.


The emulator can show both screens of the console in real time, or you can choose to see only one in full screen and assign a button to alternate between both. As for the controls, you can customize the touch buttons as you please, although your screen will most likely be filled with virtual controls. That said, Citra's official version supports external physical controllers.


Citra supports a large number of games from the Nintendo 3DS catalog, many of which have significantly better graphics than what you'd find on the original platform. Games like Pokémon Sun and Moon and The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds look incredible. You can even add graphic modifications to add higher resolution textures.


Citra is quite possibly the best and most advanced Nintendo 3DS emulator available for Android. We're talking about an open-source project created altruistically that lets you enjoy your laptop games from the comfort of your Android smartphone.
