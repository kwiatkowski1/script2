Premium Games : One of the things you can use Robux for is to buy exclusive premium games. There are some levels you may want to unlock, and without RBX, it may be impossible to do that. With RBX, you can unlock and even play special games on the platform.


Game Passes : Robux being a virtual currency is a mode of exchange, i.e., it is a pass to many levels on the game. For each level of the game, there is a required amount of RBX that must be paid; if RBX is limited, such levels or game may not be accessible to you.


Cash Exchange: No doubt, it is also a currency, which is why it can be converted into real, local currency. On the game, there is an equivalent of 1 RBX to $. The number of Robux you have determines the amount of cash you would have at the end. Thus, it would be nice if you had a great number of RBX to convert to cash.
