Looking for .CIA of UP TO DATE Pokemon ROM hacks.


-Liquid Crystal (found one on 3dsiso.com which claims to be CTR Fixed, but it is not, and the save is always corrupt.) -Cloud White (only found versions on 3dsiso.com that were uploaded before the projects completion date) -Vega Minus -Pokemon Resolute -Pokemon Sweet -Shiny Gold Sigma -Fusion Generation


You can make em yourself you know.


yeah but i read all sorts of complications arise when you try to normally convert romhacks


ive read that trying to convert rom hacks causes issues


As far as I know, Pokemon Reborn is made using RPG Maker XP (such as for example Pokemon Uranium) so there isn’t an older game they used as base. it’s a .exe file as well, which is almost impossible to port to 3DS.


OK thanks, still looking for others.

 ROM Hack [WIP] Pokémon Bun (w/ No Outlines, InstantHatch & SciresM Patches Built-in!)


WARNING. 
 
This romhack is intended for mature audiences only, you should be 18+ or have your parents permission before playing it. 
If you are easily offended by crude language, drug references, sexual innuendos and other offensive content then this is not the game for you!


Hai GBAtemp, I told you guys that I was working on a romhack and now you can finally try it out! 
If any of you are old enough to remember playing Cokémon (one of the first Pokémon romhacks) then you'll love this.


This is still an early beta build, the dialogue has only been modified up to the first rival battle and most trainers haven't been edited yet. 
The Pokémon encounter tables have only been changed on Route 01 and Route 02 at the moment. But I've added more than 25 encounters between them and many fan favorites 
(Ralts, Larvitar, Zorua, multiple Eeveelutions to name a few) as well as all the Gen I and Gen II starters. 
This will be the last update until v0.25 which will release whenever it's done. I want the next release to have everything 
(dialogue, marts, encounters, trainers, kahunas) up until you leave the 1st island done and perfected.


I have also applied several .ips patches that add some excellent features and then compiled a prebuilt CIA for everyone to enjoy. 
I will try to make a .3DS version soon, but until then please don't spam my topic asking for one. Hope you all enjoy it!


 === Story ===  
You just moved to the Alola region with your alcoholic mom! She's always looking for the next guy to spread her legs for and Professor Kukui has taken up the challenge. 
Now it's time to leave home. and abandon your mother to travel across the islands, while gathering Pokémon, seducing innocent lolis, discovering aliens and becoming a Pokémon Master!


 === Features ===  
* Wild Pokémon encounters edited, find new rare Pokémon in Alola!


* Very mature script changes, the main storyline is intact 
but all dialogue is being edited and there are lots of lulz.


* Outlines removed, making the game look cleaner and less childish.


* Eggs hatch almost instantly.


* All Pokémon are rename-able now.


* Message boxes instantly display text.


* Pokémarts up to after the first trial have been edited, lots of useful items 
including an Oval/Shiny Charm that you can buy at the beginning of the game!


* Access your PC from anywhere! Just go into your menu and select 
"Options", it takes you straight to your PC boxes!


* SciresM patch, lets you use the QR Scanner to scan a PKHex QR Code 
and easily load a Pokémon in your PC boxes. Also unlimited QR scans daily.


 === To-Do List ===  
* Finish editing the dialogue, there's so much text in this game!


* Finish editing Pokémart items and prices.


* Edit models, planning to chance main female 
character's breasts similar to the Busty May Mod.


* Revise encounter lists, add in more interesting 
"tropical" Pokemon based on location.


* Need to figure out if it's possible to apply the Pokémon Bun 
logo to the title screen and opening animation.


* Edit static encounters and in-game trades, 
add some unobtainable legendary Pokémon.


* Lots of other cool stuff! I have lots of ideas and 
I'm open to suggestions, but don't be mad if I don't use them.

. and greetz to my friends at Nintendo. If you don't like my romhack, well too bad. 
You won't be sending me a DMCA or C&D notice, I don't even live in a country that sell your products or cares about copyright infringement.


The prebuilt .cia is also uploaded if you know where to look. It uses the same TitleID as Pokémon Sun 
and will overwrite it when you install. Make sure to backup your saves with JKSM!


GBAtemp does not allow the sharing of any copyrighted files or data, DO NOT ask in this topic where 
you can download the prebuilt .cia or PM me or other users asking the same. Thank you!​
