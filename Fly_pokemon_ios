Tips to get the most out of the GPS spoofing app for pokemon go


Even though Spoofer Go is a fantastic iOS app that lets you do a lot while playing Pokemon Go, there are potential risks you need to know. Though the risks might be devastating such as a possible permanent ban from Niantic, there are ways of protecting yourself from such situations. Let’s see what you must do for a safe Pokemon Go spoof iOS.


number10


Ensure You Follow the Pokemon Go Cooldown 


Even though Niantic knows that users might still enjoy Pokemon Go while traveling to other locations, it’s incredible and unheard of for one’s locations to shift to a thousand miles in minutes. If they notice this, they will flag the account. Once your account is flagged, it means they’ll be keeping an eye on most of your activities, so you might eventually get a permanent ban.


To counter this situation, you’ll have to pay attention to Pokemon cooldown time and ensure you are patient before continuing with the game. The time will depend entirely on how far you go from your initial location. The further you go, the more you’re required to wait.


number11


Sign Out From Pokemon Go And Teleport 


Letting your Pokemon GO game continue playing while you spoof your actual location is dangerous as it can be instantly detected that something isn’t right. At first, Niantic will opt for a temporary ban of maybe seven days or one month. However, if you repeat it, they’ll be forced to ban you permanently.


That means you must log out before you teleport the GPS location so that it’s undetectable. Head to the setting and sign out of your account, then return later once you have effectively spoofed your location.


number12


Disable Then Enable Airplane Mode 


Another Pokemon teleportation hack is disabling airplane mode. This will ensure you alter your location without getting noticed. All you need to do is sign out of the game and ensure your phone is in airplane mode. You must give it a few minutes before using the Poke Go++ app. Once everything is set, you can alter the location and enjoy the game.


number13


Even though there’s a high likelihood that the methods highlighted are more likely to work, it is in no way guaranteed that they will. Other users might be unlucky that it might not work on their iOS devices, but that doesn’t mean it’s ineffective. Also, the free version of Pokemon Go you’re using will determine if it will work or not. Therefore, use this method sparingly and cautiously to avoid getting banned.


Conclusion


Pokemon Go Spoofing iOS 2023 requires an incredible location spoofer with all the needed useful features. You don’t want to leak your data while location spoofing, as it may lead to a permanent ban by Niantic. However, while Fly GPS can do a good job spoofing Pokémon, Spoofer Go has much to offer, such as location teleportation, an in-built joystick, and features customization. So what are you waiting for? Try Spoofer Go today.
