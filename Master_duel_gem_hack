Definitely useful for speed dueling the tutorial missions. It would be nice to have a no cost option to create cards.


It helped me clear through all of the solo duels I didnt want to do for the currency, which is very nice!


I would like some new cheats for it like inf gems or CP (craft points) But overall its nice for solo since you cant use for pvp.


Very nice to beat those Solo stuff without even putting down a single card. I wouldn't use it for anything else cause we may get ban.


i absolutely love not having to spend time on the solo missions ad just being able to get the rewards


Very good for solo mode would love cheats like infinite CP or something like that for obtaining cards


Getting through story mode was now a breeze thank you so much for your hardwork and look forward to more of your work


After getting used to the hotkeys a bit more, I've found Instant Win to save me a good chunk of time in the Solo mode, mainly for the daily challenge of playing 1 - 3 times - I wouldn't dare bother cheating in matches against real people.


Awesome Mod Guys! Very helpful tool and I really appreciate it, if possible is there a way to edit the CP without getting ban online?


Instant win was a bit touchy to get rolling (kept causing draws instead) but when it did start working it was flawless


Instant win saved me from the mental stress of using the loaner decks. It should be bound to its own hotkey though.

YuGiOh Master Duel codes (April 2023) - Free gems and packs


Unless you're willing to spend your life savings on packs, pulls, and decks, you'll want to watch the latest Yugioh Master Duel codes list like a harpie to keep up with the meta. Though they can be hard to come across naturally or keep on top of, we've pledged to keep an up-to-date list of YuGiOh Master Duel codes for you to use to score some free gems and packs.


Though there aren't any freely available just yet, we expect loads to show up once the game launches on mobile and the promised tournament scene gets up and running. As a competitive game with microtransactions at its core, YuGiOh Master Duel codes and other promotional freebies will be integral in keeping F2P players around.


Looking for more free gifts? Mobile games are always using codes to dish out player rewards. On the Roblox platform, All Star Tower Defense codes, Pet Simulator X codes, and Shindo Life codes are some of the most popular around. And for gacha games, League of Pantheons codes and Awaken: Chaos Era codes are everywhere right now.


New YuGiOh Master Duel codes (April 2023)



  
Not a single YuGiOh Master Duel code is available right now. Actually, they don't appear to exist, but we'll keep updating this guide with ways to get free gems.




Expired Codes:


If you're starving for free gems, check out any of the currently active in-game events or finish off any story content you still have left to do.


How do I use YuGiOh Master Duel codes?


Whether you've come across a code on social media, picked up a gift card from a store, or scored one through other promotional means, you'll need to know how to use and redeem your YuGiOh Master Duel codes before you can claim your rewards.


Right now, YuGiOh Master Duel doesn't include a code redemption box anywhere in-game. We fully expect this to change once the YuGiOh Master Duel codes iOS and Android release date comes around. So how do you redeem your YuGiOh Master Duel codes? Though your platform's typical redeem code box.


PlayStation



  
Go onto the PlayStation Store and click the '. ' button in the top-right

  
Click 'Redeem Code' and enter your YuGiOh Master Duel codes





  
Click the 'Games' menu tab along the top of Steam

  
Click 'Activate a product on Steam. ' and enter your YuGiOh Master Duel codes





  
Use the Xbox Store on your phone, console, or browser

  
Redeem your YuGiOh Master Duel codes through the code redeem menu




What's the difference between paid and free YuGiOh Master Duel gems?


Like most gacha games - the types with packs, probabilities, rarities, and paid currencies - there's a noteworthy distinction between paid and free gems.


Put simply, 'paid' gems can only be used on the platform you bought them on. So if you buy YuGiOh Master Duel Gems on a PlayStation, you won't see them when you log into your account on a Nintendo Switch.


The opposite of that is true for YuGiOh Master Duel gems classed as ''free'. Generally earned in-game or given in tiny amounts of bonus gems in bought packs, free gems will appear on your account balance no matter the platform you're on when you acquire them or when you go to use them.


Why didn't I get my YuGiOh Master Duel gems?


If you've used a YuGiOh Master Duel code and had it confirmed on the redemption screen but still haven't had the codes added to your account, here's how to fix the bug.


Right now, it appears YuGiOh Master Duel codes don't deposit their codes straight into your account or the Gift Box menu. This may change with promotional YuGiOh Master Duel codes in the future, but for now, any codes you use are likely for 'paid' gems, which fall under a slightly different rule given the cross-platform nature of the game.


To fix any YuGiOh Master Duel gems that haven't appeared, you'll actually want to go back into the in-game Gem shop. Either click it along the top menu or press 'Square' on PlayStation, 'Y' on Nintendo Switch, and 'X' on Xbox to reach it.


Once it loads up, you should get menu pop-up telling you about an incomplete purchase. Don't worry, the YuGiOh Master Duel codes went through just fine.


It's probably just an issue with the overloaded launch servers. Just click the pop-up off and you should get another in a few seconds telling you that the purchase has been reconfirmed. Look at your gem count now and you should see the amended amount.


And that's it for the YuGiOh Master Duel codes list for now. Though it isn't seeming likely that codes will arrive any time soon, the game is keeping up with limited-time free gem rewards for events and other activities. For games that always use codes, check out our Roblox guides hub and our codes guide hub for mobile gacha games.

As an old Yu-Gi-Oh fan, I'll check it out. But nowadays, I find modern Yu-Gi-Oh hard to enjoy, too many cards with very complicated effects and combinations. When you have to pay real money for the booster packs, it gets expensive. 
Duel Links was great in the first year because they used the original cards in the beginning and balanced the whole thing on 3 card field. But unfortunately it required a lot of NPC grinding and like any cards games it was still pretty much p2w. 
I only played it for so long, because you can hack instant win NPCs with max score.

UPDATE: Unfortunately as all probably already knew: 
The premium currency is of course not client side, so I am unable to do anything with it with my limited knowledge, however I do believe I found the values for the attribute orbs, will be beginning to test on that and see if any changes will take. 
I will then be working on XP for game level, as even in offline mode it seems to still be counting XP. Standby for more on that. 
igromanru, I havent the slighest idea on your progress but feel free to share, I will help out as much as I can. 
Hopefully someone much smarter than I will be able to figure out a work around for the premium currency, although I do not want to give anyone false hope as this is usually the case with these types of games, it may never be a possibility. 
For anyone else that may be concerned this is cheating online, I assure you I myself am only setting out to hopefully reduce the paywall gap, and maybe cut down on grind times. As Yu-Gi-Oh is a card game, it is also very much a game of skill, knowing how to build a proper deck along with a deep understanding of the mechanics/combos is VERY important, and in no shape form or fashion will this have any impact on actual gameplay against others. 
Much like with Legacy of the Duelist, giving yourself more currency only allows you to obtain these cards, not teach you how to use them! 
Thank you all for your interest, Ill see what my limited experience can do!

Thanks for telling these problems that you had. 
Me personally thinks that we need a editor. For me I definitely is a F2P player. 
Difficult part isn't the gem currency, because the card can be replace by those Card level elements. Having enough for example 30 units of those UR,SR thingy, it can generate the card. If its going to be unlimited for some point , it definitely helps us to getting all the cards we need but not keep pulling from those packs.


Thats why the reason I love legacy of duelist is that people can acutally change and obtaining those cards. I know how to play all the cards but don't have the way to gain all thoese cards so great appreciate for all your works.


Even though it might not upcoming for a perfect thing, We always appreciate for your hard-work. 
Thank you Mate!

I'm not surprised about premium currency, the game is completely online, you can't even start it without internet. Duel Links have almost anything server sided as well. I actually expect the experience to be server sided too. 
I haven't done much so far, was testing the game itself and watching how it works. 
But I tried already to use Iil2Cpp Inspector to dump structs and failed so far. I haven't figured out what is wrong yet. 
I don't know yet what the game will offer beside some solo missions and online PvP, accordingly, I don't know what features to expect. 
Important features in Duel Links mods/cheats are instant win against NPC with max score to grind faster. Also features like "see opponents cards". 
So I wouldn't expect much here either. When the game is bad and strongly p2w, I'm not interested in it anyway. 


I doubt that it is possible. 
If you just want to play Yu-Gi-Oh online with all cards, you can play [Link] .
