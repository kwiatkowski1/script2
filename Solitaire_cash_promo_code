How to play Solitaire Cash?



  
You can build sequences in ascending order and alternating colors by dragging cards in the tableau (seven piles).



  
Whenever you uncover an ace, place it in one of the foundation piles (four piles at the top of the board).



  
The sequences of the same suit should be built chronologically, from ace to king, in each foundation pile.



  
You can always tap the stockpile to see if it has any good cards for you to play if you can no longer move any of the face-up cards.



  
As you move cards from the tableau to the foundation piles, stack them up until you reach the highest card in each pile.



  
No more cards to play? Get a bonus for finishing early when you submit your score.



  
Your ranking on the Leaderboard will increase the faster you clear the board, and the bigger the prize will be!
