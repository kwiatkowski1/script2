Restaurant Games


Everyone enjoys eating out at a fine restaurant - there is something fun and exciting about getting dressed up and sitting down for a meal that someone else has prepared! Every big city has a plethora of different restaurants covering a wide range of cuisines - from Italian and Indian, to Chinese and fast food. If you love food and drink, you will appreciate a quality restaurant and the effort that goes into preparing a meal. If you do love cooking and food, you can try out your skills in a range of restaurant themed browser games!This type of game can cover a range of different themes but the most common are restaurant management and cooking games. Restaurant management games allow you to build your own eatery and manage every aspect of its day to day running. Cooking games on the other hand place you in a restaurant kitchen and allow you to try out different dishes and creations. We have a fantastic range of restaurant games waiting to be played! Papas Pizzeria for example is a fun restaurant game in which you must take orders, add pizza toppings, put them in the oven, and cut the pizzas! We also have the fun Penguin Diner - the aim of this game is simple; you must serve your penguin customers and make as much profit as possible! CafÃ© Panic is another brilliant game of cafÃ© management. In this title you must become a successful barista within a popular coffee shop and try to manage the customer orders and keep everyone satisfied! Finally we have The Waitress, a classic arcade game where you play as a waitress in a distinctly average cafe. Take orders from customers and do it fast to keep them happy! These are just four of our most popular restaurant games - why not check out what other fun filled titles we have to offer!

Dream Restaurant


Dream Restaurant is a serving game online 3d with stickmen, one unlike we've had on our website ever before, where you will physically work way more than in regular games of this genre, since you use the mouse to actually move the food around, instead of just giving commands or taking orders.


Work at your Dream Restaurant!


Use the mouse to move the stickman server around the restaurant, picking up the food that customers ask you in their thought bubbles, and then bringing it to their table, picking up the money they leave behind, and you can bet that they will give you a big tip if you work fast and smooth.


The cook will diligently make the food and as the number of customers increases, so does the money you earn, but make sure not to get overwhelmed, because if too many people leave dissatisfied, the restaurant's reputation will diminish, and you might lose the game.


Make each day more profitable than the last, and have intense fun, preparing for the day you might one day work at a real restaurant yourself. Good luck, enjoy!
