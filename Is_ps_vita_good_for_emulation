VITA / PS TV mGBA v0.8.4


What does the m stand for? 
It doesn’t. mGBA was originally going to be named miniGBA but as the project grew the “mini” appellation became less accurate. The name was intended to be temporary, but as the original release crept closer I couldn’t think of any better names. Other working names for mGBA included GBAc and Gerboa, but nothing else stuck.


How do I file a bug? 
The best way is to sign up an account on GitHub and post on the issue tracker. Please include the version you’re using (including the numbers and letters, if you’re using a development build), what OS you’re running on, and the names of games affected.


What is the license for mGBA? 
mGBA is licensed under the Mozilla Public License 2.0, and the code can be found on GitHub.

On loading a game I get a black screen or upside down image 
Change the display driver from OpenGL to OpenGL (Force 1.x) or Software.


mGBA has issues with my controller 
At this time mGBA’s controller support is lackluster. Improvements are planned but if using a controller is your utmost concern you may want to use the libretro core instead.


 I did something and now the game always runs too fas t! 
Make sure Fast forward is unchecked under emulation and at least one of Sync to audio or Sync to video is checked. I recommend Sync to audio only.


Gameplay or audio is stuttery 
Try adjusting your sync settings (Sync to audio only is recommended) or your audio buffer settings. Sometimes switching the audio driver also helps.

 Hacking Best PSX emulator on Vita


Hi guys, I just want to ask about your experiences of using PSX emulators on the Vita. I've tried Retroarch on Switch but there are crackling sounds. I cant enjoy Suikoden 2 at all. I've decided to try it on my Vita however I don't know which emu is the best. Thanks in advance.


PS: I've read a similar post suggesting Adrenaline but the thread is already 2 years old.

Adrenaline is the best. Adrenaline is PSP emu for PSP and PS1 games. made by Sony for PS1 games. just get the latest Adrenaline and you are good to go.


Adrenaline is by the scene legend The Flow


RetroArch is improving always. but i would recommend Adrenaline still.

Yo, another Suikoden II fan! I would suggest getting the official PSN release of Suikoden II (eBoot) and not a converted PSX game, it fixes a glitch that can happen during the fight with the mist monster boss in the mountain pass early in the game.

Which one's better though? The one released by Sony in PSN or this one? https://github.com/pyriell/gs2-bugfixes

Damn, I never knew about this patch. As for which is better, obviously the patched version seems best, although certain guides online that exploit these glitches may no longer work. As for compatibility, the mist monster issue was some sort of compatibility issue with the PSX emulator the PSP/Adrenaline runs. The PSN release was fixed for this issue, something this patch doesn't do. There have been updates to the POPs emulator though since then, so it may not be an issue. The old way of getting around it was exporting the save before the fight, doing the fight in another emulator, then saving and re-importing the save. I guess you could also temporarily swap over to the official PSN release for just that bods fight then swap back. I'd say use the bug fixed version and simply see if you have any issues. I know I'll be trying it out.
