How to Play Bingo


Playing bingo is a fun game all year long. We store our bingo boards with our game boards and pull them out whenever you are looking for some game fun.


Once you have the printable games in hand (downloaded, printed, and cut out), distribute one to each player. We like to cut out each of the bingo calling cards too.


After each player has their game card, place each of the calling cards into a bowl or hat and mix them up. Set the rules for each game. Hand out candies, coins, or small items to mark the item that has been called. The middle space or free space on each board named “Free” is each person’s first space they are given for free.


Once the player has completed the set pattern, they yell “Bingo” and they win!
