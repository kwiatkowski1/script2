C - OPS


Experience the thrill of modern warfare as you fight as a member of Coalition or aim to cause destruction as a renegade who is part of The Breach.


Opposing teams keep fighting each other until the timer runs out. The team with most kills wins.


In Defuse mode The Breach team’s goal is to plant the bomb and defend it, while the Coalition team tries to stop them. The round ends when the bomb has exploded or it’s defused. The other possible win condition for either of the teams is when all of the players of the opposing team are defeated.


This game mode is played in teams, but there is only one winner to claim the victory. Each kill accounts towards progressing through 15 weapons: the player who finishes the final level first wins the game.
